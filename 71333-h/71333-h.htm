<h3>Editors’ Preface</h3>

<p class="tall">This work does not profess to be so much a literal translation
as a somewhat free version of Dr Bie’s “Das Klavier.” The
author, writing as he does for a German public, naturally uses
a more philosophic style than would be generally intelligible
in England. Availing themselves, therefore, of Dr Bie’s kind
permission, the Editors, with a view to making the book more
acceptable to English readers, have allowed themselves considerable
liberty both in omission and in addition. For all portions
of the text which are enclosed in square brackets they hold
themselves responsible. The footnotes, except a few which are
specially marked, have been added by Dr Naylor.</p>

Old England: a Prelude<br>
</p>
</div>

<p class="small">[The drift of the remarks immediately following, which the author entitles
a “Prelude,” is, that Music is at the present time flourishing more at
home than in public; that the playing of chamber compositions is more
popular than the representation of huge operas; and that therefore it is a
suitable time to consider the history and scope of the instrument which, more
than all others, has made possible this cultivation of domestic music. He
begins then by contrasting the huge performances of Wagnerian drama at
Bayreuth with what he calls the “intimate” character of a private pianoforte
recital at home.]</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Those</span> were great days in which the foundation-stone was laid
at Bayreuth. Days in which the creative philosopher of the stage
threw his sceptre over the Ninth Symphony; days when choice
spirits met together, who tremblingly passed through the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in which they saw something never heard of become reality; days
of a joyous intoxication when Liszt and Wagner embraced each
other with tears; days that Nietzsche calls the happiest he had
ever spent, when something brooded in the air that he could trace
nowhere else—something ineffable but full of hope—those days,
alas! return no more. In those days music, that music which
the million greet with cheers of rapture, stood enthroned on the
Stage, which gives to art its public hold upon the world. The
living, new-creating music has to-day once more fled to the
concert hall, to the haughty and more select rows of aristocratic
amateurs who listen to the symphonic poems of Richard Strauss.
These are tender and delicate creations beside the dramas of
Wagner. They are elves, they elude us, and there are those,
who see them not. We have been driven to them as the highest
musical expressions of our time.</p>

<p>Since the trumpet-notes of Bayreuth died away we have
conducted our musical devotions on a smaller, more intimate
scale. Already, beyond the concert hall, we see opening the
private chamber, holiest of all, and the chamber music, which
is to the music of the stage what etching is to painting. It is
the old ebb and flow. As we passed from the single instrument
to the orchestra, from Beethoven’s orchestra with its travail for
expression to Wagner’s stage with its world-embracing aims,
so we are now passing back from the stage to undiluted music
first before thousands of listeners, then before hundreds only.</p>

<p>And now, if I had my way, I would bring the pianoforte
before a small audience, say of ten persons, not in the concert
hall but in the home, where the artist may give his little concerts,
in the fitting hour of twilight, playing to a company every one
of whom he knows. Under such circumstances, indeed, one
can implicitly trust himself to the <em>intimate</em> character of the
pianoforte. Then stream from it the sweet tones of the harp,
then, like strings of pearls, come chains of roses from its
notes, or Titanic forces seem to escape from it, and my soul
lies wholly in the player’s finger-tips. Is it then that the piano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
is a contemptible instrument compared with the violin or the
string-quartet? Do I then remember how it sings so hoarsely,
and how its scales are so broken, and how the soul of its melody
is so dead without the breath of the rising and falling tone?</p>

<p>Of course, if it expresses itself in the piano-concerto, on the
podium of the orchestra, or even if it trusts itself, in trio or quartet,
to the company of strings or wind, then it moves my compassion.
A foreign atmosphere envelops it even if Beethoven’s concerto in
E flat major is resounding; and a weakness haunts it, if in chamber
music it alternates with the dominating melody of the singing
violin. But when once the clang of the violin and of the Cor
Anglais<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has faded from our ears, and all comparison has been
laid aside, then, and then only, the soul of the pianoforte rises
before us. Every good thing must be considered <i lang="la">per se</i> apart from
all comparison. Is it no good thing to have the whole material of
tone before one’s ten fingers, to penetrate it, <em>truly</em> to penetrate it;
to feel beneath one’s nerves all the subtleties of all music—the
song, the dance, whispering, shrieking, weeping, laughter?—all, I
mean, voiced in the tone of the pianoforte, the epic tone of this
modern Cithara, which, in its own kind, embraces the lyrical nature
of the violin and the dramatic nature of the orchestra? In such all-embracing
power the piano is in the twilight chamber a strange
and dear tale-teller, a <em>Rhapsode</em> for the <em>intimate</em> spirit, which can
express itself in it by improvisation, and an archive for the historian
to whom it unrolls the whole life of modern music in its
universal speech from a point of view which gives us the whole in
the average. Then only do I love the piano—then is it faithful,
then noble, genuine, unique.</p>

<p class="p2">Queen Elizabeth of England is sitting in the afternoon at her
spinet. She is thinking of the conversation which she has had this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>forenoon with Sir James Melville—a conversation which the latter
has preserved for us in writing. He was in 1564 ambassador
from Mary Stuart to Elizabeth. Elizabeth had asked him what
was Mary’s style of dress, the colour of her hair, her figure, her
way of life. “When Mary returns from the hunt,” he answered,
“she gives herself up to historical reading or to music, for she is
at home with lute and virginal.” “Does she play well?” asked
Elizabeth. “For a queen, very well,” was the answer. And so,
this afternoon, Elizabeth is sitting at the spinet, and playing Bird’s
or Dr Bull’s Variations on popular airs. She plays from the very
(or a similar) copy which to-day is marked in the Fitzwilliam
Museum at Cambridge as Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book. She
does not notice that Sir James and Lord Hunsdon are secretly
listening. When suddenly she sees them standing behind her she
stops playing. “I am not used,” she says, “to play before men;
but when I am solitary, to shun melancholy.”</p>

<p>Fifty years before, Albert Dürer had given an illustration of
Melancholy in his famous engraving. Melancholy, as dignified
Depression, is sitting in the open air, surrounded by the implements
for Manual Labour, Art and Science. It expressed the anticipated
pain of the misfortune which lurks in the good fortune of knowledge
and intelligence; the pain of the dawning Age of Wisdom,
for which Erasmus, in his Praise of Folly, had already shown a
just contempt. In his St Jerome, Dürer represents the deliverance
from Melancholy. St Jerome, in the contemporary engraving, is
sitting quietly and contentedly at home, while the sun shines
through the circular panes,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the papers, books and cushions being
so neatly disposed around, and the lion so wonderfully sleeping
beside him. But—in the corner stands his house-organ or spinet!</p>

<p>Something of the spirit of the St Jerome breathes through the
Elizabethan music—a tone of the Volkslied, or of that intimate
world-sense, alongside of the decaying mediæval counterpoint
(decaying as the Gothic architecture was decaying) like scenes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>of popular life or of lyrical beauty, which display themselves
chiefly in the drama, in the midst of scenes of historic ceremonial.
Everyone has observed what a subtle sense for soft musical tones
is revealed throughout Shakespeare’s plays. The Duke in Twelfth
Night loves the Volkslied, the old song, “old and plain,” which “the
spinsters and the knitters in the sun, and the free maids that weave
their thread with bones, do use to chant: it is silly sooth, and
dallies with the innocence of love like the old age.” He heard
it last night; he will hear it again to-day: “Methought it did
relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected
terms Of these most brisk and giddy-pacèd times.” And it is the
fool who sings it to him—that typical figure of the love-thoughts
and of the love-business of the people: the fool, who in every play
has the largest store of old popular songs, and who in this very
drama empties a very cornucopia of them. But Shakespeare’s
holiest encomium on music is sung at night, in that idyllic scene
at the close of the Merchant of Venice, between Lorenzo and
Jessica. The moonlight sleeps upon the bank; the lovers sit in
silence before Portia’s house and let the music steal upon their ears.
“Soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony.”
Lorenzo endeavours to cheer Jessica with the music. We can
well believe that his impassioned words express the feelings of
the poet himself, who has marked his Shylock, his Cassius, his
Othello,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> his Caliban, with the stain of a heedlessness of music:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">“The man that hath no music in himself,</div>
    <div class="i1">Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</div>
    <div class="i1">Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.”</div>
  </div><!--end poetry-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Portia enters the moonlit garden and hears the gentle tones, not
knowing whence they come. She feels keenly the eternal magic
of invisible music which lies pillowed in silence and night. The
whole scene is a hymn on the infelt soul of musical self-centredness,
wherein man finds his best self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
So too, perhaps, stood Shakespeare by the spinet of his beloved,
and to his musical sense the tones and the love are blended
together, his loved one becoming transfigured into music:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">“How oft when thou, my music, music playest,</div>
    <div class="i1">Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds</div>
    <div class="i1">With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently swayest</div>
    <div class="i1">The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,</div>
    <div class="i1">Do I envy those jacks<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that nimble leap</div>
    <div class="i1">To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,</div>
    <div class="i1">Whilst my poor lips, that should that harvest reap,</div>
    <div class="i1">At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand.</div>
    <div class="i1">To be so tickled, they would change their state</div>
    <div class="i1">And situation with those dancing chips,</div>
    <div class="i1">O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,</div>
    <div class="i1">Making dead wood more blessed than living lips.</div>
    <div class="i4">Since saucy jacks<a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> so happy are in this,</div>
    <div class="i4">Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.”</div>

<p>It is in the Elizabethan age that the clavier begins for the
first time to play a part in the world. In the English clavier-music,
as in all English music at that time, there is a ravishing
bloom, which vanished just as quickly from the popular concerts,
never to appear again. Circumstances combined to favour it.
A certain repose, a dependence upon art came upon the London
society of that day, and at such times art penetrates easily into
the privacy of the home. For centuries had the Low Countries
held the sway of music; but the art of tone, which had made its
way thither under the stars of Dufay, Okeghem, and Josquin
des Près, remained in the service of the Church. It represented
the rapid development of contrapuntal vocal harmony, as it had
slowly developed itself into music <i lang="la">per se</i> from the figurations,
which at the end of the tenth century began to found themselves
on the <i lang="it">canto fermo</i> of the Gregorian material. Around the
Gregorian pillars there had arisen a mathematical system of
rules and proportions; of musical vaultings, symmetries, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>mouldings, in which the ordering
world-spirit seemed to have realised
itself. As yet, however, there was
no melody whose contour was unifying;
no harmony whose development
was to be foreseen; no singing
voice resting on the support of an
accompaniment. The voices ran according
to the laws of their <i lang="it">tempi</i>,
all equally important from soprano
to bass; and their harmony only
aided in reducing them to an average.
The <em>instrument</em> of this great sacred music was the human voice,
at first only the bearer of the tone, but then gradually here and
there betraying a greater depth of feeling: and yet this great
function of the voice had a value for expression which is not
to be underrated. Even in this mathematical tone-system there
lay the power of exhibiting nature as she is.</p>

<p>If art was to escape from these rudiments into more intimate
circles, the appropriate social surroundings must be provided.
<em>The home</em> must develop.</p>

<p>The public art of the Middle Ages had divided its favours
between church and hall; it was in the church that counterpoint
found its development; it was in the hall that the old popular
song, without making special advance, maintained itself. The
popular song ranged itself over against counterpoint, for it was
pure melody, as we understand melody to-day, and it was well
arranged as to rhythm in four or eight-bar “strains.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In
two ways, however, counterpoint and popular song might meet:
the first might absorb the second, or <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. It is well known
what took place when counterpoint absorbed the popular song:
throughout the later Middle Ages popular songs, even the
vulgarest, are taken up in masses or motets as motives for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>figures; nay, more, when they alternate, while the Gregorian
<i lang="la">cantus</i> holds its own alongside, church hymns are named after
popular songs, and we stumble everywhere upon masses named
after their underlying melody,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “L’homme armé,” “Malheur me
bat,” “O Venus,” and the like. But, as might be expected, these
are taken up utterly into the framework of the voice-mathematic;
their peculiar aroma disappears; they are thrown into contrapuntal
form. Far from betraying a worldly element, such as
Ambrose conveyed under allegorical paintings of old landscape in
religious pictures, they betray on the contrary a total absence of
the secular sense. To them the content of the melody is so
indifferent that they never once display it.</p>

<p>Secondly, the popular song on its own side stands apart from
counterpoint. Since counterpoint is the recognised style of the
time, popular song has no choice but to appropriate that means of
expression. Hence arises the Madrigal, the most festive form of
this appropriation, which sets popular themes to many parts, but
with the utmost art. It exhausts all the requirements of better
taste in secular music in the sixteenth century. Societies like the
Arcadeltian<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> have resulted in an extraordinary growth of published
material, and it is no mere accident that this process has continued
in England, thanks to the exertions of a Madrigal Society, down
to our own time. Yet the popular song was too opposed to the
choral setting to feel itself at home in this form long and universally.
It tended to unison or to the total absence of words; in
the latter case it could still remain contrapuntal and became simply
a tone-piece;<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the former the counterpoint existed, so to speak,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>simply at the pleasure of the melody, as it did in hundreds of old
melodies throughout the world. These old popular songs, of
remarkable origin in their plain melodious orderliness, became
finally the precursors of modern music. While they marked the
monodic principle, and gave to the expression the full value which
it had in all early music, they accustomed the ears to the pleasure
of the fully-outlined melody, and compelled the combination with
this of an equally well-outlined harmony. Thus the way was
prepared for the great discovery of the monodic opera, which arose
in Florence about 1600.</p>

<p>But in that wonderful drama, which the emancipation of the
secular or popular principle in the music of the sixteenth century
presents, the instrument appears as the second agent, with its
greater freedom as contrasted with the human voice. Choral
counterpoint penetrates into the music of the future in the two
ways of the one-part song and of the instrumental polyphony,
which form a quite natural whole. In proportion as vocal music
became more individual and more full of soul, the absolute
instrumental music gained in meaning. But we must mark two
impulses which necessarily condition each other. As the one-part
song was, so to speak, a victory of the logic of expression over the
metaphysic of many-parts, so the latter also was a transference of
counterpoint to the instrument.</p>

<p>[In the late sixteenth century, counterpoint can scarcely be
said to survive in any popular shape except that of the Catch or
(endless) canon, the performance of which, when the complete
melody is once learnt, is merely mechanical, and requires no great
intelligence or attention from the singer. But to perform
continuous contrapuntal music requires very great intelligence,
and such concentrated attention as is seldom found in its perfection
amongst mere singers. Instrumentalists therefore, as being
superior in these indispensable qualities, were naturally called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
upon, first to assist, and then to displace the singers, who had
allowed themselves to rest on their physical gifts rather than on
the accomplishments of the intellect.]<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thus it is the instrument
which opens to the popular song and to the dance of the same
kind, within the contrapuntal style, new paths of promise; and
this principle of popular music, after it had held itself for a
century in the almost neglected plain melody under the wintry
covering of ecclesiastical counterpoint, becomes, in a moment,
conscious of its immeasurable powers. Still, further, here there
was the ground on which the popular song, so long differenced
from counterpoint, gradually overcame it and was able to develop
its principle freshly and clearly. In the opera we see it suddenly
break with counterpoint; but this kind of art suffered by this
suddenness, since it swung uneasily to and fro from the heights of
the stage-reformation to the depths of virtuosity. Instrumental
music escaped this sudden break, took up into itself counterpoint,
transformed it out of itself, and passed on to meet a
development far more regular and advancing with giant strides.
What instrument, then, was best for the reproduction of the
contrapuntal play of the voices? Next to choral song stood the
organ, with its power of holding on its tones. Slowly, therefore,
as we might expect, the organ steps into the contest with the
church-choir. At first more clumsily, then more gently, its voices
contrast and work into counterpoint. The organ also offers,
as exchange for the sung chorus, direct transferences from motets
of Josquin and Orlando Lasso. But so soon as the organ recollects
that it is not vocal but an instrument, it begins—shall we say?—to
run off into flourishes. All kinds of adornments and grace-notes
start up, and finally the organist prides himself on departing
utterly from the composer’s or author’s intention, and embroidering
the theme at pleasure. A Prelude and a Fugue in this style
appeared to the men of that time dreadful enough to linger over;
as Hermann Finck writes, “they run sometimes by the half-hour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>up and down over the key-board, trusting thus, with God’s help,
to attain the highest, never asking where Dan Time, or Dan
Accent, or Dan Tone, or Bona Fantasia, are staying in the
meanwhile.” Further, when the organ had purified itself in the
great epoch of German church-music, it had perforce to remain in
the service of the Church. It felt the influence of the audience,
which was brought into rhythm and harmony by the secular
principle of music—that influence which, in the Protestant
Choral and in the creations of Bach, made itself felt as a brilliant
reaction of the secular musical sense on the church tradition.</p>

<p>Alongside of the organ came the lute, which for so long had
been the chief instrument of the home. Yet the lute, with its
tones drawn from so few strings, was unable to show itself very
productive. It had provided the accompaniment of songs, and
music in many parts had very early been arranged for it.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At
all times, therefore, the lute had imitated the contrapuntal style,
though in simple fashion, and occasionally certain passages had
been accented with chords thrown in arpeggio-wise. Whether
the lute accompanied a voice, or whether it took up the popular
melody into itself to produce “absolute” music, it exhibited a
style of its own, conditioned by its own limitations, even as,
alongside of the organ, it had its own note-script.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was not
convenient accurately to retain on the lute every separate voice.
An instrumental style was formed; men became accustomed to
the sufficiency of this simplicity of tone; dances were written for
the lute, as Hans Judenkunig in his lute-book offers a “Court-dance,
Panana<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> alla Veneziana, Rossina ein welscher Dantz”
and the like. As time went on, all well-known pieces were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>arranged for the lute, as they are to-day for the piano. Encyclopædias
appear—as for example in 1603 the “Thesaurus”
in ten volumes of “Besardus nec non praestantissimorum
musicorum, qui hoc seculo in diversis orbis partibus excellunt,
selectissima omnis generis cantus in testudine (the lute) modulamina
continens.” Graceful figurations arise, which in France
and Italy receive fine names, while the German lute-player
sets himself strongly against these complicated “battements,”
“tremblements,” or “flattements,” against this or that “passagio
largo,” “stretto,” “raddopiato.” But, on the whole, much as
the lute achieved, it could not suffice to compel the complete
admission of the whole musical material into the home.</p>

<p>The heavy <em>churchiness</em> of the organ and the light secularity
of the lute were thus constrained to unite themselves in an
instrument which was sufficiently flexible to effect the representation
of all the voice parts at once yet more easily than
in the choir, and which could embrace the whole tonic scale
so completely as to expand the limits of the voice both above
and below. It must be a light, moveable instrument, a miniature
of the organ. The clavier offered itself for this end; and in it
organ and lute met in fruitful wedlock.</p>

<p>Such is the position and the meaning of the clavier in the
great struggle for freedom of the secular music-principle which
fills the sixteenth century. With this begins the history of
the clavier, and simultaneously the history of the orchestra.
The orchestra flourishes where the clavier flourishes, and <i lang="la">vice
versa</i>. The combination of single instruments in a body, and
that <em>one</em> instrument which alone can represent that combination,
are manifestations of the same movement, namely, of the transference
of the church choral tone-practice into the sphere of
the secular, where in place of the counterpoint which ran on
by the hour, an interlaced system of harmonies, a strict organisation
of melodies, gradually assumed the mastery. The orchestra
occupied itself with public representations; the clavier with the
advance of the new music in the home. Already, in Venice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
had instruments taken their share with the singers in the church;
now chamber-music also began to flourish. Later, in France,
the court-orchestra gained a special significance, and very shortly
the clavier also made its importance felt. In Naples the orchestra
appears simultaneously with the Italian opera, and
shortly afterwards arises Scarlatti with his clavier-pieces. In
Old England the orchestra was regarded with a special
affection; and thus it is that in England the clavier first
flourishes.</p>

<p>The early development of instrumental music in Venice
cannot have been without its influence upon London, which not
only cast an eye on the social and topographical aspect of the city
of the lagoons, but also allowed itself to be consciously influenced
by Italian culture. So early as 1512 we hear of Italian masques
performed in the Palace at Greenwich; and when, in 1561, a
tragedy by Lord Buckhurst<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> was performed with introductory
pantomimes and orchestral music, we recognise the Venetian touch
in the individual character of the instruments. In Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> the
violin, in Act <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> horns, in Act <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> flutes, in Act <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> oboes, in Act
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> drums and pipes are set down.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The orchestra of Queen
Elizabeth exhibits strong features of the mediæval physiognomy:
there are sixteen trumpets (about equal to the number of the
singers in the associated chorus) and three kettle-drums stand
in close relation to them. It is the old official festival music
once more. Eight violins, one lute, one harp, one bagpipe, two
flutes, and three virginals are the relatively weaker supplanters
of the more intimate orchestral type. The respective costliness
appears from the account: the lute, £60; the violin, £20; the
bagpipes, £12. The Italian operatic orchestra started on the
opposite path, gradually getting rid of the stringed instruments
and adopting wind. It was, however, very thin, and even in
France the orchestra of the sixteenth century appears hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>more elaborate than a Papal orchestra of the fifteenth. It is the
English orchestra that at this time stands at the head, not even
the thirty instrumentalists of Munich being equal to it. Above
all there seems to be growing a division of labour between
orchestra and chamber-music, so much so that Prätorius, when
in his great musical work (1618), he mentions such combinations
of lute-choirs, calls this style of chamber-music especially English.
<span lang="de">“Die Engelländer nennens gar apposite à consortio ein consort,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
wenn etliche Personen mit allerley Instrumenten, als Klavicymbel
und Gross-spinett, grosse Lyra, Doppelharff, Lauten, Theorben,
Bandorn, Penorcon, Zittern, Viol de Gamba, einer kleinen Diskant-Geig,
einer Quer-Flöt oder Bock-Flöt, bisweilen auch einer stillen
Posaun oder Racket zusammen in einer Compagny und Gesellschaft
gar still, sanfft und lieblich accordiren, und in anmuthiger
Symphonia mit einander zusammen stimmen.”</span> Hence it appears
that the orchestra and the chamber-music of old England were
the chief things. In the former the wind prevailed, in the latter
the strings; but the clavier had its place in both kinds. For the
clavier, during many years, even when it had made good its
position as a solo instrument, still took its part in orchestral
combinations. Even in Hasse’s time the <i lang="de">Kapellmeister</i> at Dresden
sat at the clavier.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it is no wonder that the old
English clavier should have flourished, or that it was in England
that it first recognised its mission. The influence of this was great
enough to bring about a speedy development on the continent.
The cultivation of music was not only wide-spread, but also very
ancient; so much so that the old musical writer Tinctor (1434-1520)
expressly ascribes the origin of all contrapuntal music to
England. The compositions of the thirteenth century were, in
grace of melody, simplicity of rhythm, and modernity of harmony,
far in advance of their age. (Compare the canon in six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>parts,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “Sumer is icumen in” of the Monk of Reading, before 1226.)
It is noteworthy that the English possessed of old a popular, simple,
melodious tendency in music which reminds us of Mendelssohn.
This has made English music great and also small. Great, for at
a time when the whole musical world struggled with the contrapuntal
want of system in harmony and melody, the English were
capable of preparing the way, in systematic, plastic form, for the
new conquering secular principle. Small, because so soon as this
principle became universally recognised, they laid themselves to
sleep in the luxurious enjoyment of their tradition, and set up
foreign ideals, such as Mendelssohn and Handel,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who were
endowed with the like gifts.</p>

<p>Madrigals of Elizabeth’s time are so familiar to us that Dr
Ambros, of Prague, could produce them in Prague with great
success, drawing from J. J. Maier’s German collection. That free
geniality of the English in its ancient dress, which conceals all
triviality, overcomes us even to-day. With the clavier-pieces it is
the same. We are charmed with the extreme simplicity of their
musical form, and we love them because they come before us in an
archaic dress. They exhale an aroma whose popular sweetness
mingles beautifully with the slight harshness of their naïve style.
Allowing ourselves a touch of triviality, we find ourselves wondering
that these works seem to be quite outside their own time, and
in the modernness of their spirit surpass even the renowned contemporary
performances of Gabrieli and the other Venetians.</p>

<p>In this London, the imitator and rival of Venice, we fall upon
the first clavier-books that, as such, were ever collected in the
world. Strictly speaking, they are not the absolute first. We
read on the title-page of a collection of Chansons, Madrigals and
Dances, issued at Lyons in 1560 by S. Gorlier: “Premier Livre de
tablature d’Espinette.” We learn from Prätorius that the inscription,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>“For an Instrument,” which appears so often on old works, is
not to be understood universally, but to be confined to the clavier.
Nevertheless, it is in England that we first find in any numbers
collections of expressly-marked clavier-pieces, springing from a
special impulse of musical enthusiasm. First in interest stands
the so-called Queen Elizabeth’s Virginal Book, one of the chief
treasures of the Fitzwilliam Museum, lately transcribed into our
own script for Breitkopf and Härtel. Granting that it may have
been written after the time of Elizabeth, it yet, with its three
hundred pieces, goes back to the earliest names of this school—Tallis,
Bird, Farnaby, Bull. Next, in the library of the late
Rimbault, an important English historian of music, we find, in
manuscript, a Virginal Book of the Earl of Leicester, and
another of Lady Nevill. Doubtless great lords and ladies had
many manuscript collections of this kind, including copies of
the favourite pieces of the day. But soon manuscript gave way
to print. In 1611 appeared the first copper-engraved set of pieces
ever seen in England. This was “Parthenia, or the Maydenhead
of the first Musicke that ever was printed for the Virginalls. Composed
by three famous masters: William Byrd, Dr John Bull,
and Orl. Gibbons, Gentilmen of His Majestie’s most illustrious
Chappell.” A modern edition of this collection was issued in
1847 by the indefatigable London Musical Antiquarian Society.
From the materials collected by this Society Ernst Pauer, whose
contributions to the history of the clavier have achieved a great
repute, formed his collected edition of Old English Composers,
which presents, in modernised form, special pieces by Bird, Bull,
Gibbons, Blow, Purcell, and even Arne, who, though later, is not
uninteresting.</p>

<p>The pieces in these collections are of three kinds. First, free
fantasias,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> such as were also composed for organ and lute under
the name of prelude, preamble, or even toccata (here denoting
simply piece). In their essence fugal they are broken and intersected
by florid passages. In the second class, a canto fermo was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>taken from a church melody, and developed after the approved
fashion in fugal or figured style. Or, finally—and this is the most
usual case, and the style most appropriate to the clavier—a number
of variations, or even groups of variations, if the theme has several
sections, are formed into a series. The theme itself is a popular
song or dance. Popular songs, as they swept uncounted through
England and Scotland, are inexhaustible. Even to-day they retain
their freshness. To the whole piece they impart their tense and
melodious rhythm. The dances—in common time called Pavans,
in triple, Galliards—are frequently named after noblemen,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and are
in their variations adorned with the same encomiastic flourishes as
the songs.</p>

<p>The clavier, for which these English musicians wrote their
pieces, was of the kind called a virginal. The virginal was a
peculiarly handy kind of spinet. It is not to be assumed that,
after the quibbling and flattering fashion of the time, it was so
called in compliment to the Maiden Queen. The name is older.
Possibly it is due to the fact that the small size of the instrument
made it specially suitable for young girls. We find scarcely any
pictures of <em>men</em> sitting at the clavier. In Italy the same name
was in vogue; but we are not here concerned with the whole
history of the nomenclature of old keyed instruments. We are
only so far interested in the history of the instrument as it forms
the basis for the rise of the <em>literature</em>, i.e. <em>style of composition</em>,
which concerns us in its human aspect. The histories of the
clavier, those of Rimbault, Oskar Paul, and others, place the
history of the instrument in the foreground. Even Weitzmann
has appended to the last edition of his “History of Clavier-Playing
and Clavier-Literature,” a comprehensive chapter on this subject.
But the history of the clavier is a very complicated matter if we
are tedious on it, and a very simple matter if, without becoming
inexact, we are brief upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
It is a union of the harp with the mechanism of key-action.
Harps, in which the strings are plucked with the plectrum, are
in some form or other as old as music itself, and appear in the
most various shapes in the first dawn of civilisation. The
mechanism of the keyboard, which by means of an easy leverage
adapted to the human fingers, gives the player control over
the sounds of pipes or strings, is not quite so ancient, since it
presumes a certain inventive capacity; but it is old enough
to be equally beyond our chronological powers. In Europe we
find keyed organs as early as the first centuries after Christ.
The application of this action to stringed instruments was completed
in the monochord. The monochord, an instrument well-known
to the earliest theoretical musicians, was a board with a
string stretched across it on which the intervals could be clearly
marked and sounded by mathematical division: the half marking
the octave above the pitch of the whole length of the string;
the third part of it giving a fifth above that octave; the quarter
part giving a fourth above that fifth, namely a note two octaves
above the pitch of the whole string; the fifth part sounding a
major third above the last named note, viz., a seventeenth above
the pitch of the whole length; and so on.</p>

<p>The simple monochord developed itself after the tenth century
in two directions, the musical and the technical. Its development
was musical, inasmuch as three or four strings took
the place of the <em>one</em> in order to produce a chord instead of a
simple arpeggio; an aim which the church music attained by
the multiplication of instruments sounding only one note each
at a time. It was technical, inasmuch as, in place of the constant
alteration of the “bridge” which divided the string, <em>keys</em> were
introduced, which not only divided the string at the desired
spot, by a flat metal pin (called “tangent” from its action in
simply “touching” against the wire), but also caused it to sound.
With twenty keys and only a few strings, of course it was
necessary for several keys to divide the same string, and to sound
it at different points in its length; whereby the simultaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
sounding of several notes was brought into the proper limits.
Though thus really many-stringed, the instrument still retained
its name of <em>mono</em>chord. Gradually the number of keys increased,
and in increasing proportion the number of strings, which still
remained of equal length. About the year 1450, probably, the
clavier attained this, its earliest form of the monochord. It
served an educational purpose. Virdung, Abbot of Amberg,
who in 1511 published his German “Music with Illustrations,”
is our authority for the development of the monochord up
to the first true clavier-form—that of the <em>clavichord</em>—which is
nothing more nor less than the many-stringed many-keyed
“monochord” which we have just described. The self-contradictory
“mono” was rejected, and ‘<em>clavi</em>’ substituted (Lat.
<i lang="la">clavis</i>, a key). The <em>clavis</em> is the key which in the organ
admits the wind to the pipes, in the clavier sets the strings
in motion.</p>

<p>The clavichord introduced a new means of “expression,” viz.,
the “Bebung” (trembling, shivering), which could be applied to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
any of the notes by a gentle after-pressure of the key, a mournful,
soul-moving <i>vibrato</i>, which was only possible with the peculiar
mechanism of the clavichord, where a “tangent” both divided the
string and at the same moment instantaneously created the sound.
A slight relaxation of this pressure on the key caused a slight
lowering of pitch; a slight renewal of pressure a corresponding
heightening. The German players of the eighteenth century could
scarcely find it in their hearts to resign this delicate effect, even
for the advantages of the modern pianoforte. Here for the first
time the keyboard mechanism had succeeded in producing a modification
of the tones by “touch” alone, and the keyed instrument
had gained its soul. How confined were the old eight keys of the
Hurdygurdy,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the favourite instrument till the rise of the lute,
where the strings were strained against a rosined wheel turned by
a crank (a sort of everlasting fiddle-bow), while the keys divided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>the strings into notes—an antiquated compromise between clavier
and violin! How clumsy was the treatment of the organ-keys so
late as the fourteenth century, in which, according to Prätorius, the
keys were struck with the fist! But from this time the art of
mechanics develops quickly, and the rapid increase of the number
of keys in the clavichord shows us how speedily its supremacy was
attained. The fall of the key was shallow, the quick-sounding tone
encouraged ornamental flourishes, which were more easily played
on the clavichord than on our heavy-touched pianoforte. Yet it
was long before the number of strings became equal to that of the
keys. Not till the eighteenth century (about 1725) do we find
clavichords with a string to every key. (These are called <em>free</em>
instruments, in contra-distinction to the old <em>tied</em>.)<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is obvious
that the “tied” clavichords did not admit of <em>all</em> chords; but those
which were impossible were discords, avoided on other grounds
by the older music. To sound C and D flat together was impossible;
but no one complained, for no one, for reasons of style,
wished to try it. But, on very old clavichords, C and E are also
incapable of being simultaneously sounded—a fact which gives us
many a hint for the criticism of the oldest pieces.</p>

<p>In the form of a simple case, fit to be laid on the table, and
later when fitted with its own stand, frequently painted on top and
sides, or with its keys set in ivory and metal, the clavichord continues
to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Although the
strings were then duplicated, although it was possible to attain in
the touch stronger or weaker, louder or softer, expression, yet it
could not, with its far too great simplicity of tone, hold its place
in the rapidly hurrying development of music. It had taken one
thousand years to improve the monochord, five hundred more to
produce a clavichord, two hundred and fifty more were required to
bring the clavicymbal<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> form to its perfection; and yet a hundred
and fifty for the clavicymbal to emerge into a Steinway or a
Bechstein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
The <em>clavicymbal</em> represents a second form of the clavier,
which begins its career about 1400. Its invention is directly
due to the influence of the organ. When the clavier began to
replace the organ in the home, a desire was felt for the stronger
notes of the great wind-instrument. The clavichord was unequal
to the task. A new technique was required. The strings, instead
of being touched and divided, were plucked with quills,
which stood out at the side from the jacks, at the end of the
key-lever. For this purpose it was necessary of course that
the strings should be tuned each to its proper note, and therefore
have each its due length. The mechanism of plucking, and the
measurement of the strings, give to the clavicymbal its character
as distinct from the clavichord. The tone becomes rippling,
metallically glittering, firm and yet rattling; nay, it might be
called romantic, if it could sustain its poetical air, which it
gains for us in the first instance by its strange character. But
it was a defect that the tone was unsuitable for <em>nuances</em>; for,
unlike the clavichord, it was unable to produce <i lang="it">forte</i>, <i lang="it">piano</i>, or
the “Bebung.” Here a hint was taken from the organ. Stops,
as with the organ, were added; these, as they were drawn out
or pushed in, made it possible to use either one, two, or three
strings on any single key, thus offering three gradations from
piano to forte. Or, by the same means of a stop, a damper
of leather or cloth was put on the strings, and thus an imitation
of the lute was effected. Or, thirdly, both these appliances were
united by providing two keyboards placed one over the other,
on which at will the player could play loud or soft. Hence
arose dozens of combinations. Strings were coupled in unison
or octave, registers were made either for hand or foot, keyboards
were made to shift, the shapes of the cases were either rectangular
or in the “flügel” form (like our grand pianos) to accommodate
the gradual shortening of the strings as they reached the higher
octaves, the cases were either small, or larger, and furnished
with magnificent stands, such as were brought out by the first
famous clavier-manufactory, that of the Ruckers at Antwerp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
who flourished at the end of the sixteenth century; there were
almost as many names as shapes. Those with smaller cases
were called Virginals, those in the shape of a swine’s head were
called Spinets (“Spinet” referring to the plectrum of quill);
while the larger instruments were “Clavi-cymbals” (cembalo, a
“dulcimer”; though the clavicymbal was a <em>harp-with-keys</em>, not
by any means a dulcimer, which is the progenitor of the pianoforte,
a very different matter), or in Italy “Gravicymbels,” in
England “Harpsichords,” in France “Clavecins.” The keyboard,
at first incomplete in the lower “short” octave,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> gradually
spread itself over three or even five octaves. The fulness of
tone was greater, but the touch necessarily heavier than of old.
The new instrument was unsuited for the quick development of
a natural system of “fingering.”</p>

<p>The technique of clavier-playing advanced but slowly from
the mere tapping of the finger-ends to the dexterity of to-day,
which lays under contribution the whole arm as far as the elbow.
In the first clavier and organ “school,” which was published by
Girolamo Diruta in Venice about 1600, and which bears the title,
“Il Transilvano, sopra il vero modo di sonare organi e stromenti
di Penna,” are already to be found rules for the use of the fingers,
for the holding of the hands, and as to the differences of organ and
clavier-playing; but fifty years later, according to Weitzmann,
Lorenzo Penna,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in his “Albori musicali,” knows no other rules
than that the hand should be raised high, and that, as the right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>ascends the scale and the left descends, the third and fourth
fingers should be alternately used, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i> with the third
and second. Old pictures confirm this statement. In England
we meet notable examples of the influence of this Italian fingering.
The thumb, as the finger that passes under the others, is still for
a long time an <i lang="fr">enfant terrible</i>. The technique is still that of the
zither, simply transferred to keys. It is not till the time of Bach
that the special technique of percussion springs into existence.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to see what feats were attempted by the old
English masters of the virginal in spite of their scanty means.
We feel how they love this instrument, which, in spite of itself,
pointed out to them the way to the Promised Land of music,
namely, to the stiff rhythm and arrangement of the secular music.
For example, we actually find in the virginal books pieces by
the famous Amsterdam organist, Sweelinck, and arrangements of
compositions by Orlando Lasso, as well as all kinds of transcriptions
of Italian works; but the gems are the variations on popular
songs and the dances. In the contemporary virginal music of
Venice this relation is reversed. There the Ricercari (pieces for
lute, organ, or harpsichord, displaying the tricks of counterpoint),
the Toccatas, the Preambles, are overlaid by the heavy, clumsy
harmonies of the Middle Ages; they stagger about in uncertain
syncopations, dabbling with 5/4 time, and confused with the most
intricate figurations. It is only towards the end<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that they yield
a clear formal idea. Not until the younger Gabrieli do we see
rhythm more clearly defined.</p>

<p>In England, however, the fruitful songs and dances admit
none of these flabby harmonies; all the ornamentation of the
variations is accommodated to the simple fabric of the piece;
the clear melody is allied with an equally clear harmony; and
they are woven, by the quick and light tone of the virginal,
into a musical movement which, in order to live, must include
a thousand delicately elaborated <i lang="fr">nuances</i> of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Compared with the lute dances, which necessarily retained the
stiffness of their fabric, there is here a blossoming field, a veritable
new world. The organ gives the voice parts their character, the
lute supplies their tone-colour, but the child of these two parents
has its own standing and its own future.</p>

<p>About 1500 we meet with the first Old English clavier-pieces,
as well as Aston’s Hornpipe, a variation on a popular song. A
manuscript collection in the British Museum, known as the
“Mulliner Book” (Mulliner was a master in St Paul’s School),
offers us the earliest specimens of clavier-works of this kind, by
various masters, from the middle of the sixteenth century. Many
of the pieces by Thomas Tallis, the old master of this school, are
exceedingly rhythmical. He was organist under four reigns—those
of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, Mary and Elizabeth. There
is a canon in two parts, in lines which can be grasped at a glance,
and which makes full use of sequential repetitions—a sure sign,
from the early times of church music, of the advancing rhythmical
consciousness. Gradually there is added to the canon a running
bass, which at first sounds twice, and finally rolls forth quite unhindered,
rendering the whole picture easily grasped by the eye.
The unaided eye indeed, in these old pieces, is a good judge.
Without being preoccupied by the archaism, which perhaps wearies
the ear, it detects the intellectual art of the composer, as it were, at
a certain distance. It observes the great and small curves of the
voice-contours, sees the succession of the canonic themes, notices
the parentheses in which long passages are confined, and the
delight of the composer in the clearness of the pattern. It is
indeed as a finely-sewn, carefully-fashioned pattern that we see an
exercise of this kind, simply worked out, but richly adorned with
broken chords—such, for example, as the figuration of the “Felix
namque” which Tallis has as the third piece in the Fitzwilliam
Virginal-Book. The <i lang="la">nuances</i> of the accompaniment rejoice in their
ornamental existence.</p>

<p>William Bird, the pupil of Tallis, whose life reaches from 1538
or 1546 to 1623, would be reckoned as the father of modern piano-music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
if only this English school had exerted some influence on
art, and did not stand so isolated in musical history. We shall
call him the first of the clavier-masters. Both organist and singer
in the Royal Chapel, where both services were alternately demanded
from all the adult musicians, he had a considerable interest
in the monopoly of music printing and of the music paper duty
which was granted by Elizabeth first to Tallis and then to him.
A happy man he was not; he appears to have suffered more than
most in the religious persecutions of the time. We have hardly a
word in the authorities as to the hours of work of these old musicians;
but indirectly we learn from the Act against Rogues and
Vagabonds that private instruction was a not unusual <i lang="la">parergon</i> of
the musicians.</p>

<p>Prosniz, the collector of all clavier-literature, in his “Handbuch
der Klavierlitteratur”—a work not to be implicitly relied
on—calls Bird’s music coarse and tasteless. Weitzmann agrees,
saying that it is composed with intelligence and art, but heavy
and without soul. But this is the fate of all transition styles. If
we observe, from the standpoint of modern music, the traces of the
old style, as for instance the change of time and the “flabbiness”
of the harmony in the Fantasia, which comes eighth in the Virginal
Book, or the cross-passages in the interesting Piece 60, they are
indeed coarse and tasteless. But we must endeavour in such
things to put aside the modern point of view. Mediæval music is
not a preliminary step to the modern, but something quite different.
It is pictorial, as the other is plastic. If we would hear their
“molluscous” harmonies, and their indistinctness of rhythmical
arrangement, we must lay aside the rhythmical canons of modern
music; we must accept the molluscous nature and want of distinctness
as something purposed, and we must follow without
preoccupation this web of voices, enjoying it note by note. The
piece is so delicate, so quite in colour, that the last note is a shock
to us. In fact, the conclusion of these pieces, with its formal clash,
under which the harmonies and voices assemble themselves in a
stiff group, is a contradiction to their inmost being, a desertion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the pictorial principle and—in a word—the germ of the coming
style. In a greater degree than we can bring ourselves to believe,
the ultra-modern expression-music is allied to this conception of
the art of tone.</p>

<p>It is true that we justly judge Bird chiefly from the modern
point of view, since we are investigating the progress of history,
and therefore work for the new, the developing, rather than for the
old. But it is precisely from this point of view that he presents
such surprises that we are not at first able to form a decisive
opinion about him. I find a quiet pleasure in observing his
harmonies, which are felt rather than calculated, as, for example,
the sudden D major chord in the famous song, “John, come kiss
me now” (Virginal Book, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10), and in studying the delicate
parallel legato passages, the gradual change of melody, the growing
complexity, the unusual variations, the alternation of hands, the
rhythmical developments. In the ninth variation there run together
plain quavers, dotted quavers, and the melody above all.</p>

<p>New suggestions, aroused by the clavier, are constantly being
introduced. Prelude <abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr> has a stiff structure. The Passamezzo-Pavan
and Galliard (<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 56 and 57) present broken chords as a
genuine clavier-motif, and the most delicate canonic repetitions by
means of a thematic modulation from the key of F to that of G.
Very neat is the descending D C A in the seventh galliard-variation
alternating with E D B. Bird is particularly fond of writing
a passage based on a chord of F, and immediately followed by
another based on G. This is akin to the practice of the drone in
bagpipes, and has analogy with the ancient “Pes,” or “pedal” two-part
vocal accompaniment in “Sumer is icumen in.” The similarity
to the bagpipe drone is rather striking in “The woods so wild”
(Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 67) or in “The Bells,” where the
lower bell voices repeat themselves in a way that reminds us of the
pedal bass of Chopin’s Berceuse.</p>

<p>The rich technique of “Fortune” (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 65), the wealth of
figures in “O Mistress Mine” (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 66), the harmonies of the
Passamezzo dances (<abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 56 and 57), cling to the memory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
But chief are his two most modern clavier-pieces—the variations
on “The Carman’s Whistle” (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 58) and “Sellinger’s Round”
(<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 64, where the piece is complete, not abridged as in Pauer’s
edition). These have often been issued in popular form, and
in Pauer’s collection are provided with modern execution marks.</p>

<p>“The Carman’s Whistle” is a perfected popular melody, one
of those tunes which will linger for days in our ears. At the
beginning of the third and fourth bars Bird sets the first and
second bars in canon, in the simplest and most straightforward
style. Next come harmonies worthy of a Rameau, with the
most delicate passing notes. In the variations certain figures
are inserted which are easily worked into the canonic form, now
legato with the charm of the introduction of related notes, now
diatonic scales most gracefully introduced, now staccato passages
which draw the melody along with them like the singing of a
bird. Finally fuller chords appear, gently changing the direction
of the theme. From first to last there is not a turn foreign to
the modern ear.</p>

<p>The “Sellinger’s Round” is more stirring. Its theme is in
a swinging 6/8 rhythm, running easily through the harmonies
of the tonic, the super-dominant and the sub-dominant. It
strikes one like an old legend, as in the first part of Chopin’s
Ballade in F major, of which this piece is a prototype. The first
variation retains the rhythm and only breaks the harmonies. Its
gentle fugalisation is more distinctly marked in the third variation,
which at the conclusion adopts running semiquavers, after
Bird’s favourite manner, anticipating at the conclusion of the one
variation the motive of the next. The semiquavers go up and
down in thirds, or are interwoven by both hands, while melody
and accompaniment continue their dotted 6/8, in a fashion reminding
us of Schumann. In the later variations the quaver
movement is again taken up, but more florid and more varied
with runs which pursue each other in canon. This piece, perhaps
the first perfect clavier-piece on record, which had left its time
far behind, was written in 1580.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Alongside of William Bird stands Dr John Bull (1563-1628).
These two represent the two types which run through the whole
history of the clavier. Bird, the more intimate, delicate, spiritual
intellect; Bull, the untamed genius, the flashing executant, the
restless madcap, the rougher artist. It is noticeable how these
two types stand thus together on the very threshold of the
clavier-art.</p>

<p>John Bull, at nineteen, became organist of Hereford Cathedral,
and at twenty-two a member of the Royal Chapel. In the following
year he becomes Bachelor of Music of Oxford, three years
later Doctor of Music of both Oxford and Cambridge. When,
in 1596, Sir Thomas Gresham founded his College in London, he
was made Professor in Music, and that without (as the statute
demanded) lecturing in Latin. But he held this post no more
than five years. We find him, “on grounds of health,” travelling
in foreign countries. His playing created the greatest enthusiasm.
The French, the Spanish, and the Austrian courts were in a furore.
Like all later executants, he is the subject of myths. There is an
anecdote that a kapellmeister of St Omer showed him, as an
extraordinary curiosity, a piece in forty parts.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Bull, nothing
daunted, added another forty parts to it. The kapellmeister
stares, and takes him for the devil himself. After an absence of
six years he returned to England, where, like his satanic prototype,
he resists all authority. He resigned all academic positions,
threw up his post in the Royal Chapel, and in 1613 again set
out, without permission, for the Continent. Four years later he
emerges as organist of Notre Dame in Antwerp, where he died
in 1628.</p>

<p>From these few biographical notices we figure him as a
restless ambitious spirit. As the peaceful life of a mediæval
painter is to the splendid existence of the seventeenth century
artists, so is the relation of Bird to Bull. And Bull’s works
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>exhibit many of the lineaments of an elegant <i lang="fr">faiseur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He is
not so fond as Bird of the primeval freshness of the popular
songs and dances, nor does he work out his pieces with Bird’s
virgin purity. The side-issue is often with him the main object;
the figuration is often licentious, and both hands vie in the
performance of the closest and most difficult passages. Often,
indeed, his pieces assume a grotesque appearance, hard and
antiquated harmonies, in which the leading note is conspicuous
by its absence, being crossed with runs in semiquavers, dotted
rhythms, rapidly intruded chords, four-fold imitations, syncopated
grace-notes, mingled two and three-time passages in wild and
bewildering confusion. The eye looks as it were on a specimen
of Indian ornamentation, in which, among the confused lines,
a pure human feature is almost indistinguishable. From the
first piece of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, Bull’s thirty “Walsingham”
Variations, which later Bird treats so much more
simply, the executant shines out in his whole personality. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>are thirty studies on figure motives which in Bird are reduced
to a dozen. The semiquavers run like will of the wisps in their
most unsubstantial courses, resembling endless chains, which are
here and there interrupted with leaps of a sixth or seventh, to
knit them together in the self-same run higher up or lower down.
The ornamentation is richer than with Bird, melting in its
<i lang="it">sfumato</i><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the lines of the voice almost after the manner of
Couperin. The clavier, even more than the organ, lent itself, with
its isolated tones, to such trills, slurs, and mordents,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which give
to the sound an apparently longer existence. It is these that,
down to the time of the German classical music, give the stamp to
the special physiognomy of the clavier-piece. I called them just
now <i lang="it">sfumato</i>. As in painting the sharp outline of the body
gradually gives way to greater truth to nature, and in Lionardo
is replaced by the specifically pictorial obliteration of the <i lang="it">sfumato</i>,
by which, so to speak, we see round the corners; so the ornamentation
in these pieces, in which the clavier is seeking its own
means of expression, assumes the habit of obliterating its thin
outlines until finally the figures thus obtained regulate the lines
of the melody as a fixed motif, or even become an end in themselves.
It takes an inner effort before we can transplant ourselves
into this old world of ornamentation. We must learn to
feel it as it would be played by the old masters: we must, if
possible, play it ourselves on old and lightly-responding spinets.
Our heavy and serious pianos are unsuitable to them; they
sound too forcibly and harshly. The average pianist cannot
play them; and hence, in his new edition, Pauer has for the
most part cut them out.</p>

<p>Doctor Bull’s flying fingers, utterly altering as they did
many a church-tune and many a dance, were constantly making
discoveries among the clavier-figures, just as the worst of executants
has since done. Thus, in Bull’s somewhat bewildering
forest, we find many a germ of future wealth: broken triads,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>which even in the contrary motion of both hands delight us
in the midst of all kinds of consecutive fifths; broken octaves,
of which Beethoven was so fond, a greater frequency of the
crossing of the hands, by which the voice-part gained a wider
field, and finally endless repetitions of the same note, either
singly or in the middle of a passage,—this last a genuine clavier-device,
for which later the new repeating mechanism was invented.
Also, in harmonic relation, Bull seeks out many novelties, boldly
bending the voice-part to his will; as he does in the truly
stupendous Prelude <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 43, in the Virginal Book, or in the
bold enharmonic modulation in Piece 51, an exercise in <span class="allsmcap">DO, RE,
MI, FA, SOL, LA</span>, a theme which appears a tone higher at each
repetition, starting from G, in the midst of close figuration,
until the C sharp simply changes to D flat.</p>

<p>There is a Lute Book of Bull’s in Vienna which gives us pieces
like the following: “Miserere Mei,” “Galliard,” “La chasse du
Roy,” “Salve Regina,” “Canon perpetuus, carens scriptura, notulis
in systemati positis scriptus,” and so on. Let us not think too
badly of them. The Virginal Book also has a variegated collection.
In the time of variations, “variatio delectat,” there are
collections for household use, which are not necessarily an indication
of a want, on the part of the originator, of the sense of the
characteristic in an instrument. At this epoch the instrument
delivers men from the mediæval love of grouping instruments.
And I even find that Bull in certain pieces has shown a noteworthy
sense for characteristic. He has once a simple bag-pipe
melody e f e d e f d c, called “Les Buffons,” with a series of variations
in humorous style. There are at first chords with simple
broken accompaniment, then hopping semiquaver figures, then a
popular canon, then slurred sixths, and similarly right on to the
conclusion, which is as usual fully harmonised, in the turns of
which, of course, his want of plasticity, as contrasted with Bird,
is clearly shown. More striking still is the working out of his
best-known piece, the variations on the fresh delightful song, the
“King’s Hunt,” giving us a romantic reminiscence of horns and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
trumpets. Something of this
romance runs through his
figures. He uses the horn-motive
of the second part
specially for a longer variation,
which is simple and full of
character. The flourish of runs
in quavers, which he also uses
in Galliard <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 17 of the
Virginal Book, and the systematic
answering of right-hand
chords by the left hand,
which appears also in Galliard
11, are here specially characteristic.
We seem to see tramping
horses and waving flags
delineated in ancient technique. He was specially good in such
hunting pieces. On the musical side, as his somewhat awkward
variations on the fine “Jewel,” though among his best
pieces, clearly show, he cannot be compared to the magical
Bird; but his sense for characteristic and for technique has aided
the advance of the clavier. Both of these superiorities are parts of
his nature, which expressed itself most completely in this style.
The clavier needed both types.</p>

<p>The most characteristic and notable piece of this school is the
third in the Virginal Book, a Fantasia by John Munday, which
represents no less a phenomenon than the changes of the weather.
Over its sections, which have no thematic connection, but have
various distinctions of rhythm—<i>e.g.</i>, quietly moving semibreves
and minims; jerky dotted quavers interspersed with semiquaver
rests; extensive runs in semiquavers, etc.—he writes in this
succession four times each, “Fine Weather,” “Lightning,” and
“Thunder.” Instead of “fine” appears once “warm” weather;
and a slow passage, marked “a clear day,” forms the conclusion.
The characterisation is of course extremely superficial, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
last time the lightning rolls just like the thunder. But this novelty,
as a symptom, ought not to be overlooked. It reveals to us the
consciousness of characteristic, and the increasingly intimate character
of the clavier. Technically, Bull inaugurated a school. Of
the various authors of the Virginal Book, Ferdinand Richardson
(who exhibits pure part-writing), Giles Farnaby, Orlando Gibbons,
Peter Philips, to a large extent follow his footsteps. Farnaby thus
early writes pieces for two virginals; he darts, in the midst of his
technique, through a graceful “Spagnioletta,” and often lights on
interesting modern passing chords, as, for example, running
upwards, b, f sharp, d, a, where a follows b and c d. In the use
of chords Peter Philips (who arranges many pieces of Orlando
Lassus in the Virginal Book) stands in the first rank. In the
Pavan (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 76), which is dated 1592, he has in the conclusion<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
unheard-of simple alternating triads; in the Galliard he deals with
the most beautiful suspended chords; and in the “Galiarda
Dolorosa” (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 81) he introduces chromatic colouring.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> We
can perceive how much he must have learnt on his Italian and
Dutch travels from the flourishing art of the Continent. The
spirit of Bird does not exert so powerful or so enduring an
influence as that of Bull. The anonymous Piece 14 of the Virginal
Book is a famous Alman (German dance), which in the severity
of its subject reminds us of Bird, and its working-out is done by
means of single-note passages of melodious motive.</p>

<p>In their clearness of arrangement and harmonious development,
so far as they do not deal with dance or song, the majority
of the pieces of the Virginal Book are marked by the spirit of
the Toccata of the great Dutchman Sweelinck, which appears as
Piece 96. Here the spirit of Bach is seen before its time. Gradually
the distinctive edges of individuality fade away. A piece by
Thomas Morley on the theme, “Goe from my window,” whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>melody he himself partially employs again in his “Nancie,”
appears again almost unaltered in the same Virginal Book, and
is then ascribed to John Munday. With John Blow, Henry

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> What were known as “short octaves” were to be seen almost in our own time in
certain old organs. For three centuries the following or a similar arrangement was
practised. Supposing the lowest notes of the keyboard ran thus: E, F, F sharp,
G, G sharp, the first E being that under the bass staff. But when the E key was put
down, the note <em>sounded</em> was the C a third below; when the F sharp key was played, the
resulting note was the D below; the G sharp key produced the low E, which should
have had its own key to itself. Thus the keyboard, which apparently stopped at E
under the bass staff, really had D and C below, arranged to sound on two other keys.
So to produce a diatonic scale beginning from the low C of the violoncello, the keys
actually played had to be: E, F sharp, G sharp, F, G, etc., which would produce
C, D, E, F, G, etc.</p>

<p class="footnote">The “isolation” of the early English clavier school is fairly explained by the
immense amount of attention that was now given, from 1600-1695, in England, to the
development of the dramatic scena or cantata, for one or two voices, to the song, and to
the cultivation of concerted music for strings and keyed instruments. It is only to
prevent any one from supposing that there was <em>no</em> “secular” music in England between
the days of Elizabeth and the coming of Purcell that I give a few names, all of which
have a real claim to remembrance. Songs—Campion (flourished 1600), Johnson (1600),
Cæsar (early 17th cent.), Cooper (1612), Laneare (1620), H. Lawes (1630), Wilson
(1640). Cantatas or “Scenas”—H. Lawes (1630), C. Colman (1640). Instrumental
music—Gregorie (mid. 17th cent.), Jenkins (1630), W. Lawes (1630), Lock (1650),
Sympson (1660).</p>

<h3>Old French Dance-Pieces</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> independent musical fame of England—omitting Purcell,
the evening star—rests solely on this early period. Hence we
have been led to trace the musical history of England further
back than that of countries where the stream spread over a wider
area. Old English music, indeed, had no influence worthy of the
name. It stands, like a half-mediæval prelude, before the actual
history of the piano. It is true that it shows the forces which are
to work in the future; but they are not yet brought into the line
which they are constantly and exclusively to follow. This process
begins rather in France; it unites itself later with a second movement
which comes from Italy, and follows a broader and
more lively path through Germany until it reaches our own
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Oskar Fleischer, the founder of the splendid Berlin collection
of old musical instruments, has endeavoured, in his book on
Gaultier, the great French lute-player, to describe English and
French relations in the seventeenth century. But the hints which,
in his view, the elder Gaultier<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> gained in England, are only
matters of execution. Flourishes which in England were marked,
without precise discrimination, with / or //, found a more exact
representation among French lutenists. I do not mean that every
performer did not put his own interpretation upon them. Every
lutenist or clavier-player issues a new code of these <i lang="fr">agréments</i>;
but the basis remains essentially the same, and it is possible that
the flourishes were adopted, by an impulse derived from England,
into lute-music and thence into clavier-music. Thence they soon
spread themselves over the whole musical field. But it is a
mistake to imagine that these <i lang="fr">agréments</i>, which infest old French
compositions like locusts, were a peculiarity of the country, the
“style galant” of France. The peculiarity lies elsewhere, in the
form, in the dance.</p>

<p>English clavier-music had attached itself to the song. From
the song it derived its stiffness of form and the grace of its melodic
outline—two important aids in the advance of music. But its
treatment of these pieces was conducted in a manner which
reminds us of the middle ages of music. The form, a continuous
succession of variations, sprang from the idea of figuration, which
constituted the essence of mediæval music; and the voice parts
were worked out in general on the fugal principle or in canonic
imitation, both factors of the mediæval music. The early ripening
of English music, and its close connection with the old Dutch
vocal or organ composition, brought it about that the <em>form</em> rested
still partly on tradition, while the <em>content</em> already pointed towards
the future. Even dances were worked out in this manner, which
belonged especially to the time. In France the system was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>exact opposite. There, the form of the variation, and the absolutely
fugal clavier-exercise, are as seldom found as the simply-harmonised
song.</p>

<p>The emancipation in France was due to the attainment of
a point of departure which was as distant as possible from anything
vocal. The dance—although of course there were some
sung dances—had early allied itself with the purely instrumental
exercise. It has never been treated so entirely “à plaisir des
gorges,”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as Gargantua expresses it. It had a stiff arrangement
in common with a stiff harmony. It never showed much affinity
with the contrapuntal twists and turns of the voice, to which
song associates itself so easily from its close connection with
choral music. If we compare the earliest instrumental dances of
the sixteenth century with the dances, in several parts, of the
old song-books—the “Rat’s-Tail,” the “Crane-Bill,” “Fox-Tail,”
“Cat’s-Paw,” “Peacock’s-Tail,” and the like, we see how rapidly
the influence of the instrument over a clear and light vocal current
was increased in France. Here especially does the dance, from
the very earliest times, enjoy great popularity. It is very early
set to the lute or the clavier, other instruments being but rarely
employed. Men grew accustomed to pieces in a condensed
musical style, harmonised simply and melodiously, contracted in
form. These were regarded on their own merits, and not as
subjects for variations and figurations. It was for this reason
that the French clavier-piece was more fruitful, more musical,
and more capable of development than the English.</p>

<p>The dance then is the darling conception of French music;
and French dances are the nucleus of all instrumental music.
So early as 1530—for we can go back a great distance—the
Paris printer, Attaignant, the oldest of French note-engravers,
published all kinds of musical volumes “reduict de musique en
la tablature du jeu d’Orgues, Espinettes, Manicordions,”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>We wonder to-day how M. Attaignant could transcribe his pieces
“out of music” into the script of organs, spinets and monochords.
But by “music” he meant nothing more nor less than song, and
song, down to his day, was nothing more nor less than music.
A few years after the German music-publisher Agricola<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="de">
    <div class="i1a">“Drumb lern singen du kneblein klein</div>
    <div class="i1">Itzund inn den jungen jarn dein,</div>

    <div class="i1">And give thereto thy heart and mind.”</div>
    <div class="poemright">[E. E. K.]</div>
  </div><!--end stanza-->
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">For music, he had once before said, is the foundation on which
all instruments rest. Attaignant was one of the first to make
transcripts of this “music” for keyed instruments. Nay, more;
as far as our knowledge goes, he was the first who in general
printed for such instruments. On his title-pages stand for the
first time the words spinet and clavichord, although the claims
of the organ are allowed. And it is noteworthy that the dances
play the principal part in his books. Here the Frenchman
already peeps out. Galliards, Basse-dances,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Branles, Pavans, are
brought into a clear and relatively good harmonic form, without
much complication of the instrumental parts. They are often,
as for example in a charming Galliard in F major, of entrancing
<i lang="fr">naiveté</i>. Not too many runs in the treble, not too much harmony
in the bass, and all exquisitely adapted for the instrument.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>A hundred years after, the dance still rules French music, and
not merely French music, but French life. The forms of social
intercourse, as they were fashioned for the universal use of Europe
at the court of the Parisian princes, were modelled on the broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>rhythms of the dance. Going and coming, bowing and sitting,
complimenting and smiling—all the pleasure in the formal beauty
of hollow conventionalities, all this is nothing but the light and
yet regulated step, the theatrical and yet sympathetic essence of
the dance. The French people, having resolved to live their life,
determined to do it prettily; and therefore to put even their
ordinary motions and common gestures under the mild rule of
the dancing master. Even in rough and ready England, traces of
this are extant; witness the would-be grace of the formula of
“introduction.”</p>

<p>In lute-music the dance takes the form of ceaseless corantos
and sarabands; on the stage it supplies the framework for the
love-representations of the time. In 1671 appeared <cite>Pomona</cite>,
Perrin and Cambert’s first French public opera. In it, cattle
drivers and agricultural labourers ply their dances. The great
Lully, most fertile composer of the nobly tedious French national
operas, is inconceivable apart from the school of the dance. His
tunes, at every possible opportunity, run off into the beloved
dances of three or four strains, now inserted in airs and prologues,
now as episodic dances. By this means the flexibility of the voice
parts increases year by year; and since Lully is a composer for
the clavier, many of his dances easily adapt themselves to clavier-arrangements,
to which indeed they are very early subjected.
Lully is the most vigorous teacher in the rehearsal of opera-dances.
The style and the school of dances reach such a height in Paris,
that they give the law to the whole world just as their social
etiquette does. “France,” writes Mattheson, “is and remains the
true school of dancing.”</p>

<p>After the time of Lully, who had done so much for the development
of the characteristic dance, the art advances with rapid
strides. The Pantomime was invented by the Duchess of Maine:
it was in 1708, at her famous festivals, “les Nuits de Sceaux,” that
the last scene of the fourth act of Corneille’s “Horace,” was pantomimically
represented with musical accompaniment.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Of old the parts of women in the dance had been taken by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
men. Lully ventured to introduce female dancers. Here begins
the epoch of famous “danseuses” who, in accordance with a natural
law, become the centre of public interest. We owe to Castil Blaze
a list of those <i lang="fr">grandes dames</i> who took up the profession. Henceforward
the art of song and that of dancing divided equally the
popular affection, for the two were not always separate callings.
La Prévost was the first to essay a solo dance, which she set
to a violin solo of Rebel. La Pélissier inaugurated costume-dances.
She had purchased the whole wardrobe of Adrienne
Lecouvreur, lately deceased, and was thus able to appear in the
ballet “Le Carneval et la Folie,” in the characters of Jocasta,
Mariamne, Zenobia, Chimène, Roxana, Paulina, Célimène, Agatha,
and Elvira. Next we see rising the star of La Camargo, who
from her début in the ballet “Caractères de la Danse,” was the
amazement of the world, the discoverer of operatic airs set to the
dance, the glass of fashion, the arbitress of mode, against whose
decisions there was no appeal. But, as Castil Blaze tells us in
his history of the French theatre, all were surpassed by La Sallé,
with her noble figure, her lovely form, her perfect grace, her dancing
so full of expression and voluptuous languor. Not only does
she dance; she writes dances. She invents a Pygmalion, in which
the divine statue assumes life, and engages in a long pantomime
with the sculptor, who teaches her to assume her humanity by
means of the measured motions of the dance. La Sallé brought
this ballet on the stage in London first and then in Paris; and the
London correspondent of the <cite>Mercure de France</cite> writes to his paper
of the extraordinary furore created by the new art. For Sallé had
at last rejected the lingering relics of the old ballet—the anachronisms
of costume—in order to be able to give full expression to the
spirit of the dance. “She ventured,” says the correspondent, “to
appear without skirt or bodice, with loose hair, and absolutely unadorned.
Over corset and undergarments she had only a simple
muslin dress, and seemed the very image of a Greek statue.”
Sallé appears to have practised her dances without virtuosity,
as a mere artistic representation. She essayed no acrobatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
leaps, no <i lang="fr">entrechats</i>, no pirouettes. Contrasting her with Camargo,
Voltaire exclaimed:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
    <div class="i1a">“Ah, Camargo, que vous êtes brillante!</div>
    <div class="i1">Mais que Sallé, grands dieux, est ravissante!</div>
    <div class="i1">Que vos pas sont légers, et que les siens sont doux!</div>
    <div class="i2">Elle est inimitable, et vous êtes nouvelle:</div>
    <div class="i1">Les Nymphes sautent comme vous,</div>
    <div class="i2">Et les Graces dansent comme elle.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The victories of the dance were universal. Even public
ceremonies were taken up in its advance. The “Messe des
Révérences” was altered into the “Ballet des Écrevisses.” In
their first delight of dominion, love and the pleasure of life
revel in the light and magical rhythms of the dance. The great
and flourishing masked balls of the opera, acquiring a new rapture,
lead on to new dances—the Calotins, the Farandoule, the
Rats, Jeanne qui saute, Liron Lirette, le Poivre, la Fürstemberg,
le Cotillon qui va toujours, la Monaco—old songs of universal
popular origin; or, like wines and laws, named after towns and
races, and now, as dances, naturalised on the parquet. How
ancient is this connection between song and dance, in which
the name of the song remains attached to the dance! This is
a process which is of daily occurrence in our music-halls.</p>

<p>Famous <i lang="fr">danseuses</i> received characteristic nicknames. The
elder Duval du Tillet was called “La Constitution,” because
her father was an eminent clerical constitutionalist; the younger
was affectionately dubbed “Church Calendar.” La Mariette was
called “the Princess,” on more private grounds. It was the same
with their male companions. The three brothers Malter were
called “the Bird,” “the Devil,” and “Knickerbockers.” I stay to
refer to this as this French nickname-mania explains the bizarre
inscriptions of so many clavier-pieces. An amusing story is told
of a certain Cléron, who, in the demi-mondaine circles from which
her beauty and seductive arts had brought her to the opera, was
known as “Frisky” (Frétillon). In the opera she greeted her new
friends very affectionately, but added, “I shall do my best to be
agreeable to you; but if any one calls me Frisky, let him know I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
will give him the best box on the ear he ever had in his life.”
Mademoiselle Cléron was no boaster, adds the narrator, and was
pretty likely to keep her word.</p>

<p>The due understanding of old French clavier-music then,
must start from the knowledge of the dance. Almost all its
pieces are dances, whether they declare themselves as such or
not. They take up the numerous existing dance-forms and
develop them in the ways already described. But in addition
to this formal principle we must notice a second, the symbolic.
The pieces <em>mean</em> something, and mean more and more the
further the century advances. As if to console themselves for
the want of content which belongs to the dance in itself, composers
are fond of indicating in their titles and dedications all
kinds of relations which give to their pieces a more marked
physiognomy or a more comprehensible expressiveness. For
this purpose they had not only at their disposal the old song-names
which clung to the dances, but a hundred other associations.
They loved the dance, but they loved associations also. Nicknames
and allusions flew from the smiling lips, and men had
the fairest inducements to take the abstract in a concrete sense.
The chief inducement was the stage with its representative music,
the stage, so passionately loved by the French in the middle
ages that even from the thirteenth century we have dramatic
lyrical plays with the most delicate songs by the trouvère Adam
de la Hale. These stand like flowers in the midst of their
time, and penetrated so deeply into the life of the people that
the little song of Marion “Robin m’aime” is still, they say, sung
in the Hennegau. The fairies, which had already played their
part in the works of this mediæval opera-composer and writer,
had in the later French opera their rich harvest of beings of
symbolic meaning. In Lully’s works there is quite a swarm of
abstract figures, gods, demi-gods, personifications, which in small
scenes or great airs bring out this characterising function of music
to the utmost degree possible. But what such things as the
good and bad Dreams, or the nymphs and Corybantes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“Atys,” entering as chorus, performed in characteristic music
was as nothing to what was done by the great ballets which
drew heaven and hell into the circle of their representations.
“Le Triomphe des Sens,” “Les Voyages d’Amour,” “Les Génies,”
“Le Triomphe de l’Harmonie,” “L’Ecole des Amants”—all these
are titles of operas and ballets of those times which had as their
aim to represent musical things as symbols of sensuous incidents.
From the lists of ballets and operas performed from Lully’s time
right into the eighteenth century the application of fêtes, rococo-amusements,
love-pictures by Watteau, or idyllic porcelain-ornamentation,
to stage purposes, speaks with no uncertain sound.
In such an environment, recollecting the renowned fantastic art
of the contemporary Callot, we are led to understand the unusual
preference for the direct association of clavier-pieces with particular
persons or things.</p>

<p>But here we must speak specially of programme-music.</p>

<p>A Pavan called “La Bataille,” full of vigorous trumpet-signals
and horn-echoes, was inserted by Tielman Sufato in his collection
of 1551. Shortly before that date a Zürich lute book included
dance-songs, “mitsampt dem Vogelgesang und einer Feldschlacht.”
The song of birds, the imitation of animals, and all kinds of confused
shrieking—a comic counterpoint—offers rich material to the
programme-music of the sixteenth century. Even before an Italian
had written the famous fugal chorus, in which the scholars, with a
comical employment of the dismembered canonic voice-exercise,
declined <i lang="la">qui</i>, <i lang="la">quæ</i>, <i lang="la">quod</i>, in the ears of the raging schoolmaster—even
before this, contrapuntal janglings were well known.
Jannequin, the Frenchman, depicted in <i lang="fr">chansons</i> with many
parts the battle of Marignano, the capture of Boulogne, war,
jealousy, women’s gossip, the hare and hounds; or, on the other
hand, the song of birds, the lark or the nightingale. We hear
in the music of this time the thirds of the cuckoo, the clucking
dactyls of the hen, the chromatic mewings of the cat, the trills of
song-birds. The boldest of these pieces—an earlier Howleglass—was
perhaps Eckard’s representation of the turmoil in St Mark’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Place at Venice (1589), in which noblemen, beggars, hawkers,
soldiers, appear with all the artistic counterpoint appropriate to
their respective classes. Thus programme-music, in the sixteenth
century, enjoyed an international repute. It must not, however,
be regarded as an achievement of modern music, but rather as
something as old as music itself. The tempest which the Greek
Timotheus represented on the kithara, and the fight of Apollo with
the Python, which Timosthenes depicted on the flute and kithara,
in all its stages—the challenge, the struggle, the hissing, the
victory—had a renown in very ancient times. Programme-music
belongs to all ages of musical development, and appears always as
a natural phenomenon, never as a revolutionary movement. It
marks the <i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of the need of musical expression, which
cannot find satisfaction in pure musical forms, and seeks to justify
itself by extra-musical titles. Thus on the extreme limit of ancient
hymn-music stood a Timosthenes, on that of mediæval choral-music
a Jannequin, on that of modern instrumental music a Berlioz.</p>

<p>We can trace the psychology of this programme-music with
great ease in the French instrumental art of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. From the first definite orchestral programme-piece—the
storm in Marais’ opera Alcyone—to the volume of
François Dandrieu, “contenant plusieurs Divertissements dont les
principaux sont les caractères de la guerre, ceux de la chasse, et la
fête de Village”; from the lute-dances of Gaultier to the clavier-pieces
of Rameau, we see nothing but an endeavour of the
developed dance-form to enter into relations with actual life—an
endeavour which leads to the manifold names of the pieces.
Formerly the dances had taken their names from the songs.
Now, as definite pieces, they are so full of special significance, so
rich in all kinds of characteristic figures and harmonies, that the
composer feels his mind insensibly drawn to incidents of life, of
persons, of characters, humours, landscapes, and calls upon all his
fertility in association to fashion decorative titles out of them.
Music, which has arrived at the limits of the traditional dance-forms,
passes over from the formal to the characteristic. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Berlioz’ Queen Mab is nothing but a further development of Beethoven’s
Scherzos, and not a heaven-descended music, discovered
in Shakespeare, so the pieces of the great clavierist Couperin,
whether they have descriptions of humours or personal names for
titles, are merely the developments of dances, which, so fertile were
they, reminded the composer of life itself. Couperin himself
declares that he gives in his pieces portraits, which appear to give
to others also, before whom they are performed, the actual features
of the models. But it is obvious that he could hold himself as
a portrait-painter, only so far as his music was rich enough, by its
definite relations to actual life, to give clearer definition and a distinct
picture to its stream as it flowed in a thousand forms. Like
all programme-musicians, he is such, not from poverty in musical
invention, but from wealth. The French are a people that revel
in the fulness of forms, and find their very life in the special magic
of the formal presentation of all things, whether social or artistic.
Thus in their hands all musical forms, melodious, harmonic,
rhythmic, grew so luxuriantly, that at all times, from Jannequin
to St Saens, in order to live they have necessarily turned to
programme-music.</p>

<p>Yet the titles of the clavier-pieces are not fully explained by
this reference to the value of programme-music for the French
mind. We must take into consideration also an old decorative
tradition. Let us open the magnificent volume of lute-pieces
by the famous Denis Gaultier,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> which came into the Berlin
Museum of Engravings along with the Hamilton collection. It
is fantastically called “La Rhetorique des Dieux,” because only
gods could speak so movingly by music, and equally fantastically
he introduces all kinds of titles for the pieces, such as “Phaethon
struck by lightning,” “le Panégyrique,” Minerva, Ulysses, Andromeda,
Diana, “la Coquette virtuosa,” and the like, besides several
“Tombeaux,” by which term dedications to deceased persons were
generally indicated.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> If we compared these sixteenth century
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>pieces with their names, a certain nimble fancy is required to find
actual programme-music in them. Of a genuine representation
of the content there is no pretence. Minerva, Echo, and the
Coquette would seem to have more in common than they ever
suspected. The titles are nothing but decorative stamps, resembling
those medallions of Aphrodite which are so often engraved
over a love-poem. The interpretation is always in the
widest spirit possible. It is amusing to see how the editor of
the collection labours to explain the names while confining
himself exclusively to the vaguest generalities. On “l’Homicide,”
or The Fair Murderess, as it is also named, he writes: “This
fair creature deals death to every one who sees and hears her;
but this death is so unlike the usual death that it is the beginning
of a life, not its end.” It could not easily be more plainly indicated
that there is no clear representation of anything to be
seen in the piece, and that the title is a piece of self-flattery
in the dress of the fantastic. Already had the elder Gaultier,
the founder of this lute-school, recognised, or perhaps even
invented, these decorative titles, such as “le canon,” “la conquérante,”
“les larmes du Boset,” or “la volte,” “l’immortelle,”
“le loup.” This last, it is certain, is no ordinary wolf, but
howls so musically that it is really a man.</p>

<p>The custom of adding decorative titles was made universal
by the lute-players, but the tone-painting must always have been
of the slightest. Otherwise the old historian of the lute, Baron,
could not have been so irritated at them as to write, some decades
later, “Gallot has given such strange names to his pieces that
we have need of close study to see their relation with the subject.
For example, when he wishes to express thunder and lightning
on the lute, it is a pity he has never added a note to tell us <em>when</em>
it lightens and <em>when</em> it thunders.” (We are reminded of the old
English clavier-piece on the same theme.) “We shall seldom,”
he adds, “light on a French piece but the name of some noble
dame is attached to it, after whom, if she so pleases, the piece
is named.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
The clavier-players adopted this custom all the more willingly
as their instrument, so full of resource and so capable of
expressing shades of meaning, allowed them to raise these titles
from their decorative and shadowy existence into genuine
programme-inscriptions. We see this remarkable process clearly
exhibited in Chambonnières, a clavier-player who towers in
solitary grandeur, and marks an epoch by his introduction of
the clavier <i lang="fr">suite</i>, by the clear adaptation of his dances to the
clavier, by the first realistic use of these titles, and by the
establishment of a precise character in the clavier-piece, which
holds its ground even to-day. He is not, like William Bird,
the original of modern clavier-music, but its actual father, from
whom a straight unbroken line stretches down to the present
day.</p>

<p>Jacques Champion de Chambonnières sprang from an old
family of organists, and was born at the beginning of the seventeenth
century. The year of his death seems to be fixed as 1670.
Titon des Tilliers, who in 1732 wrote his “Parnasse Français,” a
work of great antiquarian research, says of Chambonnières that he
played the organ very well, but the clavier with special genius, and
that his pieces as well as his execution gained a considerable renown.
His fame increased until Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> appointed him his chief
clavier-master; and his compositions appeared in two volumes.
In Titon’s times these pieces were still admired. Copies of these
works are very rarely to be found to-day; but the great French
historian, Farrenc, had the good luck to get possession of one
of them, and he has freshly edited it in his famous collection of
old clavier-music, “Le Trésor des Pianistes.” While Attaignant
still bound his dances together according to their classes, there
are here mixed sets of dance-pieces after the example of the
lutenists, in simple setting, but with the adornments of the time.
The succession is not yet so elaborate as in later <i lang="fr">suites</i>, and <i lang="fr">courantes</i>
stand often one on top of another. The construction of
the melodies has still a certain gentle, unforced charm, which gains
our attention though its influence is scarcely irresistible. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
canonic element appears strongly only in the Gigues, three-time
dances with a lively movement. Every piece has its dance-inscription,
and some have in addition their special titles, as La
Dunkerque, La Verdinguette, la Toute Belle, Iris; or more distinct
indications as the Slider, the Barricades, the Young Zephyrs, the
Peasant Girl. A Pavan with slow conclusion in three sections
is called “The Conversation of the Gods.” Here the sliding, the
zephyr, and the peasant, are easily to be recognised in the music.
Nevertheless, complete liberation from the merely decorative
framework of the fantastic title was not yet attained.</p>

<p>The man to accomplish the great work was François Couperin,
called by his time “the Great.” The piano-player of to-day hardly
knows his name; and yet it is only two hundred years since men
spoke of him in the same breath with Molière and Watteau. A
genial, smiling, clean-shaven man—so the somewhat unsatisfactory
portraits depict him—with half-length peruke, polite and yet
slightly subtle, with a certain priestly sobriety of demeanour, his
light fingers run over the hundred adornments of his spinet-pieces.
He seems half astonished at his fame, and wholly ignorant that
a whole art is one day to rear itself on his shoulders. It was
only with difficulty that the pressure of his friends induced him
to print his dances, which he wrote for himself in memory of his
experiences, or the preludes which he wrote as exercises for his
numerous pupils, or the concertos which he composed for Louis
<abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>’s Sunday musical evenings. He watched with painful
anxiety the tedious process of engraving. As we to-day inspect
these prints, we are struck by the joyous <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> of the art, by
the graphic awkwardness with which the notes overflow the
five-lined limits of the clef, and by the soul which breathes from
the delicately-engraved prefaces. He thinks that his portraits
are accurate pictures, and thankfully acknowledges his indebtedness
to the intimate character of his instrument. His notes as
to execution, his “gaiement,” “tendrement,” and “sans lenteur”
(he is always warning the performer against slowness) and all
the other guides to interpretation which he inserts, he excuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
by saying that the pieces
seemed to express something
which could not be embraced
in accurate language. In spite
of all this pedantry of teaching
he appeals to the sensitive
musical appreciation which will
find the right way of interpretation;
and in spite of all
this reference to the spiritual
momentum of music he is a
stern disciplinarian in form and
technique. In the midst of the
utmost freedom of movement
we discern a strong feeling for
style, just as in the contemporary architecture the most playful
license of the rococo is strangely mingled with the most sober
attention to classical rules.</p>

</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>The Couperins, like the Chambonnières, were a widely spread
musical family. It was old Chambonnières who, in a noteworthy
fashion, had discovered Louis Couperin, the uncle of François.
One morning the father of François and his two brothers who
lived in the neighbourhood of the old master, brought a serenade
for his inspection. Chambonnières was struck with it, asked
after the composer, brought him to Paris, and thus laid the
foundation of the fame of the family from which the great
perfecter of his work was to spring. François was born in 1668.
He lost his father when he was ten years old, but in Tomelin, the
organist of St Jacques-la-Boucherie, he found a teacher and a second
father. His life, as its details have come down to us, was simple
and uneventful. He became organist of St Gervais and chamber-clavierist
to the king, and died in 1733. But the dedications of
his works enable us to conceive him more definitely. He appears
in them as the professional artist and man of the world, pampered
by noble ladies, and kissing their hands with graceful flatteries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
We see him as he moves in the salons of Paris, which were then
beginning to realise their mission. He is the admired artist of
the court which he charms with his chamber-music; the intimate
of the Duke of Burgundy and of the Dauphin, of Anne and
Louis of Bourbon, giving his lessons and receiving pensions of
a thousand francs. A true lady’s man, he thinks the hands of
women better adapted to the clavier than those of men. He is
the first to sanction ladies in his own family as clavier-players.
His daughter Marguerite Antoinette, and his cousin Louise, played
at court. Marguerite even became the teacher of the Princesses,
and was official royal clavier-player—in France certainly, and
probably in the world, the first woman to hold such a post.</p>

<p>The music of Couperin has something of this feminine quality.
It is more truly “virginal” music than that which Queen Elizabeth
once played in her quiet chamber. But its grace is not hidden; it
is coquettish and conscious of itself. It is the high style of grace
which belongs to the French culture of the eighteenth century. A
spinet stands on a smooth parquet, and the ladies sit around with
their roguish eyes and tip-tilted noses, smiling at all the well-recognised
allusions, as the then flourishing pastel-art has fixed
them for us in light colours. It is light, entertaining music, in
which the thoughts of their own accord run on bright and resplendent
paths. Short pieces; <i lang="fr">courantes</i> with their lively, scarcely
broken triple-rhythms; <i lang="fr">allemandes</i> in their decorous and interwoven
quadruple time; <i lang="fr">minuets</i> with their pretty, melodious triple
rhythm; <i lang="fr">chaconnes</i> and <i lang="fr">passacaglie</i> rearing their piquant erections
on slow-moving basses; <i lang="fr">sarabands</i> in their triple movements and
interesting national colouring; <i lang="fr">gavottes</i> with their graceful movement
in soft two-time, the hurrying fugal <i lang="fr">gigues</i>, and all the many
other unnamed dances—all these give the ear, without exertion, a
subtle delight. The rondo-form takes a supreme rank; it is constantly
growing from a simple round-dance with refrain into a
genuine clavier-composition, seeming to forebode the sonata which
still remains unborn within it. Its theme, like a Ritornel, recurs
among the “couplets” or episodical passages; but it is only seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
that the couplets set themselves in conscious opposition to the
theme. Usually they adopt its rhythm or the character of its
melody, and play with it until, neatly and gracefully, they glide
back into the theme itself. There is no iron rigidity of thematic
handling. A delicate colour-sense holds the parts together.
Couperin does not regulate his pieces according to any definite
scheme of dance-successions; he binds the dance and the non-dance,
the piece in one or more sections, together into one
bouquet which he offers to his lady-friends, often with a polite
dedication appended, under the general title of “Ordre.” Twenty-seven
such “Ordres,” in four volumes, were published by him
between 1713 and 1730.</p>

<p>The music of Couperin is as simple as possible. But we must
not judge its sound by the somewhat heavy pianofortes of our
time, which, even in the playfulness of a rapid passage, seem conscious
of an <i lang="fr">arrière pensée</i>. No; the spinet, which, even at its
saddest, had a joyous exhilaration—this was the instrument of
this playful music. The passages glide on, usually in two voices,
of which the one is played by the right hand, the other by the
left; and whether these voices are tied in chords or chord passages,
or whether—as occurs more rarely—full chords, usually
arpeggio, stand between, in either case there is a delicacy which
recalls to us the origin of French clavier-music in the sweet-toned
lute. But Couperin advanced yet further. In his last “Ordres”
his compositions increase in depth; the more luxuriant conceptions
and deeper feelings of a lesser Beethoven show themselves;
the playful and ornamental element recedes into the background,
and the compositions become those of a master who
has summed up whole centuries of music in himself. From the
insipid melodies of Lully’s time Couperin has fashioned more
graceful and charming turns of expression; not only roguishly
dancing-melodies, in which the vigorous popular songs seem
to live again, but also melodies of the intellect, in which the
soul of Mozart might seem to dwell. He prefers to advance
in the diatonic scale; and the sense for the general outline of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the composition, which is so often wanting in the older generation,
is in him so unerring that he permits, with inimitable skill,
the semiquavers of his “papillons” to sway up and down through
entire bars. Yet occasionally his melodies seem ashamed of
their nakedness, and, as in the “Sailor’s Song,” draw the flowery
robe of adornments so closely round them that we can scarcely
trace their limbs. There are the well-known short and long
grace-notes, upper or lower, the <i lang="fr">pincés</i>, <i lang="fr">ports de voix</i>, <i lang="fr">tremblements</i>,
and the whole apparatus of ornamentation, which was then larger
than it is now, and which, in spite of the stern admonitions of the
composer’s marks, was frequently at the mercy of the performer.
Like almost all composers of that day, Couperin gives in his first
volume the table of his ornamentations, but he insists strongly on
their exact carrying out. To players of to-day his <i lang="fr">agréments</i> are
anything but pleasant. They seem to destroy our sense for the
pure run of the voices, and are painful in their superabundance.
But we must play them with <em>historical</em> fingers, and seek to understand
the psychology of their expression. They give to the quick
clavier-tone a significance of its own; they are, so to speak, running
drills, cutting the tones deeper into the relief of the piece,
some more, some less, until they bring out the light and shade
which serve to aid expression in the material of the clavier. Could
we hear Couperin play, we should certainly hear the pure voice
more distinctly than we imagine, enfolded as it would be here and
there by deeper or brighter shadows of the ornamentations which
bring out its form in plastic manner. His was a technique which
was lost to us with the thorough comprehension of this music.
Couperin took pains to bring it to the highest perfection. At
times he introduced a slight tempo rubato; he took from the note
at the conclusion something of its length, and gave to another at
the beginning a short pause for breath, inventing for the former
the mark of aspiration, for the latter that of suspension. Here the
endeavour was the same as with Prall-triller<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and grace-notes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>Instead of the ornamentation, the short pause, like the white
mounting of a picture, raises the important note, giving to it its
meaning and with the meaning the due expression. But later,
in the last “Ordres,” Couperin must have felt the inadequacy
of these marks. The aspirations and suspensions retreat into
the background, while the sign ) becomes more prominent. This
sign simply marks off an independent musical phrase in order to
resign its due interpretation to the sympathetic feeling of the
player. Such is the trouble he takes with the traditional style
of ornamentation and its spiritual expression.</p>

<p>But the remaining musical peculiarities of his composition
follow the simplest lines of development. Freedom of motive
increases. Tremolo accompaniments, interesting sequences, a
playful counterpoint—this latter especially in the pieces for two
claviers, or in the “Pièces croisées” for clavier with two manuals—in
fact an inexhaustible array of new forms arises. Thus the
harmonisation simplifies itself along with the advance of the
entire musical development. Couperin modulates, into the dominant
or sub-dominant, by means of their related notes, in major
and minor keys. By his turn for repetitions of short figures on
changing basses—a truly modern motive—or by bold passages
of passing notes—for instance, in the saraband “La Majestueuse,”
we find once e flat, d, f sharp, g, a, one over another—he gives
us interesting harmonies, which appear, especially in the <i lang="fr">allemandes</i>,
as full, heavy chords, already anticipating Bach.</p>

<p>The theatre of Couperin is rich and varied. The representations
which we see in this theatre under the innumerable titles of the
pieces, range over the whole world. Some of the characters are
also not strange to us; others we soon learn to know; a few
remain unintelligible to us since the relations they betoken are
too subjective. But all lend to the pieces a personal value and
an intimate charm, as Goya’s editions present them to us; and
it is from them that the clavier derives its great significance as
interpreter of this intimate personal art.</p>

<p>“Nanette” greets us with her pleasant quavering melody;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
“Fleurie” is more subtle, and sways delightfully in richly-adorned
6/8 time; the “Florentine” blooms in graceful, gentle play of
quick triolet-figures; but the “Garnier” has the dress of the
confined fantastic time, having not yet cast off her heavy folds.
“Babet” is “nonchalamment” contented; “Mimi” has a temperament
which the many slurs and points of the ornamentation
can scarcely fully exhibit. “Conti” (or “les Graces incomparables”)
works lullingly out her counterpoint; “Forqueray” (or
la Superbe) has a physiognomy of almost academic severity.
Many ladies pass by us in these pastel-portraits. We are amused
with the divine Babiche (Les amours badins) and the beautiful
Javotte (or the “Infanta”); but the most beautiful in melody is
Sœur Monique, an intellectually delicate creation, and the most
beautiful in construction is “La Couperin” (perhaps the musician’s
cousin Louise) who poses before us in a masterly, stately, and
slightly fugal movement.</p>

<p>Then follow the troops of nameless ones. First the nuns—the
blondes in the minor and the brunettes in the major section.
Then the charming and melodious representatives of landscapes:
Ausonian, Bourbon, Charlerois, Basque. Then the “Enchantress,”
who of course in process of time suffered much from her magic.
Then the “Working Woman,” who finishes her course, but is surpassed
in it nevertheless by the “Diligent One.” The “Flatterer”
and the “Voluptuous Woman” are a relatively quiet pair. The
“Gloomy One” is sharply defined, with her dismal, jerky passages,
and the heavy full chords. The “Sad One” exhibits the light
sentimentality of all archaic melodies. The “Spectre” sweeps
past in slurred thirds. Close behind come the “Gray Women”
with their ponderous sad march. The “Fox-Tail” has tripping
broken chords; the “Lonely One” shows her caprices in the rapid
successions of grave and gay. Then follow, in endless succession,
the “Princesse d’Esprit,” “l’Insinuante,” “l’Intime,” “la Galante,”
“la Douce et Piquante,” faithful ones, <i lang="fr">risqué</i> ones, bold, visionary,
mysterious ones, with their chromatic descents. “Le Turbulent”
is one of the few men in the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>His more general portraits are the most satisfying. They
depict emotions, characters, animals, plants, landscapes, occupations,
bits from all kinds of life, which are often inscribed with
the favourite antique titles. Thus “Diana” with her broken chords
leads us into the forest, and shortly after in the second part we
hear her horns sounding; while in the “Hunt” a more romantic
note is struck. In a broad violoncello-like “Romance” the wood
gods are singing and the satyrs dance a very melodious and
attractive Bourrée. The Amazon rushes on in thirds, which bear
a striking likeness to the <i lang="fr">leit-motif</i> of Die Walküren; and Atalanta
runs past in rapid figures. Hymen and Amor sing a marriage-song,
the former in the first part more firmly, the latter in the
second more delicately and tenderly. The Bells of Cythera
sound to us from the holy island, rising and falling alternately,
enlivened by glissando-passages. This motive Couperin adopted a
second time in “Les Timbres.”</p>

<p>The Bees hum and revolve round one point; the Butterflies
flutter past in ravishing triplets; the Fly buzzes and dances round
her own melody; the retiring Linnet hurries through restless triplets;
the complaining Grasshopper chirps in endless imitative short
grace-notes; the Eel twists itself now tightly, now loosely; the
Amphibian creeps along in legato notes, winding itself through
bar-sections of Schubertian length; the Nightingale in Love sings
her piercing plaintive accents in quick and ever quicker trills, or
as Victor chants more joyfully and triumphantly. Or, again,
blooming lilies rise before us in delicate self-enfolding figures
with petal-like ornamentations; the sedge rustles eternally to its
melody; the poppy spreads abroad a wonderful secret mysterious
tune, with many slow arpeggio thirds; and garlands twine themselves
in festal guise on a canonic trelliswork.</p>

<p>Life unfolds itself in its entire wealth. Here we have the
rolling play of the waves, there the purling and rippling of the
brooks, and the twittering of the birds—a foretaste of the slow
movement of the Pastoral Symphony. Then again, under the
name of “Bontemps ou l’étincelante,” an appeal is made to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
emotions of springtide or fair weather; we live as it were in a
small forest of enchantment. In the second part—Les Grâces
Naturelles—one of Couperin’s most intellectual melodies breaks
forth, showing all the chaste delicacy of Mozart. There rises
the blooming landscape of St Germain en Laye; farther off we
catch a sight of teeming orchards from which the music of bagpipes
sounds forth. The reapers draw nigh with cheerful song;
the buffoons—males in minor and female in major—stir their happy
limbs; the jugglers appear and ply their tricks;—we can hardly
distinguish the trick and its solution, or the rapid intermingling
of left and right hand—the knitters lace their rolling semiquavers
together right to the “falling meshes” at the end; the click-clack
of the lace-makers—tic, toc, choc, tic, toc, choc—beats joyfully
hither and thither in the broken chords of a <i lang="fr">pièce croisée</i>. Even
the milk-maids of Bagnolet have their appropriate pieces. There
the gossipping wife—a reminiscence of Jannequin—beats her rapid
bubbling motive; there the short rolling courses of the famous
little windmills play their humorous part; here hobbles a cheery
lame man along; there staggers a <i lang="fr">bizarre</i>, syncopated, now swift,
now slow Chinese. “The Man with the queer Body” makes his
springs, in scattered notes, and close by stands the idyll of
“Dodo,” or “Love in the Cradle,” the bass of which rocks itself
to and fro in a <i lang="fr">pièce croisée</i>. “Wavering shadows” glide ghost-like
in sadly-sounding movements throughout this play of life.</p>

<p>The “Sentiments,” full of feeling, with their beautiful “anticipation”
notes, the long legato-movement of the “Idées Heureuses,”
the “Regrets” and “Amusements” musically darting to and fro,
the syncopated tender “L’Ame en Peine,” the wonderful “Langueurs
Tendres,” the somewhat lengthy “Charmes,” the “Agréments”
with <em>their</em> agréments, the free diatonic of the various
morning melodies,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the gentle toying of the “Bagatelles,” of the
“Petit Rien,” of the “Brimborions,” the rapture-like “Saillie”—these
are inward reflexes which have not quite the clear sensuousness
and realism of the outer experiences. The following are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>the most elaborately worked out, and are presented in “cycle”
form.</p>

<p>The “Earlier Ages” appear in four figures—the first exercise
gives the syncopated “Muse naissante,” the second the rocking
“Enfantine,” the third the rioting “Adolescente,” the fourth the
“Délices” in violoncello style, which is Couperin’s favourite for
the attainment of the most delightful effects.</p>

<p>Or the great “Shepherds’ Feast” with the twanging musettes
of Taverni or Choisy, and the lightly rocking rhythms.</p>

<p>Or the five-act Ballet of the “Pomp of the great and ancient
Menestrandise.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Act <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, the pompous entry of the Notables and
sworn probationers. Act <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, a bag-pipe song of the hurdy-gurdy-men
and beggars. Act <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, a joyous dance of the jugglers, clog-dancers,
and Merry-Andrews with bears and monkeys. Act <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>,
a duet of the crazy and the lame. Act <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>, breaking up of the
whole troop by the animals—furious étude in semiquavers.</p>

<p>Next, the cycle of the old and young men; the former sober,
the latter happy.</p>

<p>But, before all, that original of Schumann’s Carnival, “Les
Folies françaises ou les Dominos.” Maidenhood in invisible
colours, Shame in rose, Impetuosity in red, Hope in green, Faithfulness
in blue, Perseverance in gray, Longing in violet, Coquetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>in a domino of many colours, the old gallants in purple and gold,
the cuckolds in brown, silent Jealousy in dark gray, Rage and
Desperation in black. Externally the form is that of a great
ballet of the time; internally it is the variation of collected pieces
on a single harmonic succession, its contents are the allusions
easily comprehended at the time; the characterisation is carried
through with great skill; but its musical setting is even shorter
than is usually the case with Couperin’s clavier-pieces.</p>

<p>The Preludes, which Couperin appended to his “Art de
Toucher le clavecin,” he named, in accordance with their <i lang="la">ad
libitum</i> performance, the Prose of clavier-literature. These dances
and pictures were to him the poetry, rhymed and rhythmical.
And it was precisely their formal completion which was of
importance for the future of clavier-literature. We see the forms
developing. In his best pieces the Sonata is already foreshadowed.
The fulness of motives, as they occur to him in his
two best compositions, the splendid “Favorite” and the stupendous
“Passacaille,” is elsewhere thematically limited. In the
recapitulation of the main theme at the beginning of the second
part of the pieces, in the rhythmic similarity between the rondo-motive
and its “couplets,” in many a thematic working-out,
shown for example in “La Trophée” with its wonderfully modern
sonata-style, lies the promise of thematically-developed music
of succeeding generations. To the same purpose is his increasing
sense for the association of several pieces. The many slow
second pieces, or the popular dances such as the Polonaise, the
Sezile, the Musette, which form the concluding parts of a group,
the repetition of the first part after the second, the divisions into
slow movement, slower, and lighter, which are specially visible
in “La Triomphante,” and “Les Bacchanales”—all these are as
much the germ of the future sonata arrangement, as the severer
thematic was the germ of sonata-playing. The charm for us lies
in observing, in the springtime of art, the natural uprising of these
forms which appear to us almost laws of nature.</p>

<p>His “Art de toucher le clavecin,” the first school-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
specially devoted to the clavier, was published in 1717 and
dedicated to the king. This was a noteworthy advance. There
was to be no longer a teaching of mere notation, but a teaching
of technique and execution. “The method which I here propose,”
says Couperin, “is unique, and has nothing to do with the tablature,
which is only a counting of numbers. I deal here chiefly
with all that belongs to good playing. I believe that my observations
are clear enough to please connoisseurs and to help those
who are willing to be helped. As there is a great difference
between grammatical and rhetorical rules, so there is an infinite
distance between tablature and the art of good playing.” Such
a general musical “fabrication” and grammar, in spite of many
advanced ideas, had been the work of St Lambert, which appeared
from 1702 to 1707, and which in its first part (called “Principes
du Clavecin”) devotes only a few lines to actual clavecin playing,
and extends the second part (called “De l’accompagnement”)
also to the organ, and other instruments. It is painful to him
that his experience is treated lightly and turned into a “school.”
The parents of the pupils, he says later, ought to place the most
implicit reliance on the teacher, and yield him the completest
powers. The teacher even takes the key of the instrument with
him, and no playing should be attempted without his supervision.
The scholar sits with his fore-arm horizontal before the clavier,
elbows, hand and fingers in a line—the fingers thus lying quite
flat on the keys. He has his body turned very slightly to the
right, and the right foot a little stretched out. In order to prevent
grimacing while playing, he often places a mirror in front in
which he can watch his motions. A bar over the hands occasionally
regulates the equality of their height; for the holding
of the hands high makes the tone necessarily hard. Looking
about of any kind is forbidden, and above all, coquetting with
the public as if the playing were no trouble at all. And although,
finally, everything in the performance depends on experience,
taste, and feeling, yet rules are given for performance to which
the player must conform. Couperin frequently disregards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
fingering of his predecessors, and to the examples which he gives
of his new art he adds confidently in a side-note that he is convinced
that few persons in Paris have the old rules in their heads—Paris
being the centre of all good. Step by step we have harder
and harder studies developed from a single figure, and directions
for finger exercises fill the rest of the volume. The change of
fingers on one note, the avoidance of the same finger twice in
scale passages, the first application of the thumb in passing under
are his characteristic points. These are all symptoms of the
endeavour to form a legato style suitable to the clavier; they
are the external indications of the suppression of the lute.
Couperin’s abhorrence of a vacuum runs through his whole
teaching of the clavier. The adornments, the avoidance of too
long note-values, the legato finger-exercise—all are the systematic
development of the powers which arise from the necessity of
<em>short</em> tones in the clavier. He once introduces a charming short
fugal <i lang="fr">allemande</i>, in which both voice-parts work in contrary
motion in most flowing style in order to show what “sounds
well” on the clavier, and opposes to it the one-sided broken
chords of the Italian sonatas of whose light style he has on other
grounds the highest opinion. “The clavier has its peculiarities
as the violin has <em>its</em>. If its note cannot swell, if the repetitions
of one tone by striking do not suit it, it has advantages on the
other side, precision, neatness, brilliancy, and width of compass.”
Perhaps Couperin was the first who had an absolutely good ear
for the clavier.</p>

<p>In comparison with him his elder and younger contemporaries
must give place. Dumont, le Begue, D’Anglebert, Loeilly,
Marchand, Dandrieu, and even the brilliant Rameau, composer
of operas and founder of modern musical theory, are his inferiors.
It is now demonstrated that Rameau published his first clavier-compositions
in 1706, seven years before those of Couperin. But
these pieces had just as little meaning and result as those of
Marchand which appeared the year previously. They must have
differed little from the style of the old school of Chambonnières.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Rameau in later years
is much freer and more
developed, like Couperin,
whose work he continued
with the happiest
results. He is no pioneer,
but an improver of the
ways. How powerful
are his <i lang="fr">allemandes</i>, how
dainty his <i lang="fr">gigues</i>, how
brilliant the conduct of
the thematic in his
Cyclopes and his Trois
Mains! What a depth
of invention appears in
his variations on Gavottes,
in his Gigues, and
in his splendid Niais de
Sologne! How wonderfully
melodious is his
“L’Enharmonique,” what a realism is there in his “Hen” and
in the “Call of the Birds”! How clear, how penetrating, how
rich in promise is his technique! In him there are musical
conceptions of extreme penetration and melodious harmonic
turns which live for ever in the ear. From the “twenties”
to the “sixties” all kinds of new editions of his works were
produced, so popular were they, as they would still be, if the
public knew these enchanting little works.</p>

<p>Thus the fame of the clavier is fixed in the Paris of the
beginning of the eighteenth century, and its future assured. It
is a kind of symbol of history that from the guild of violinists,
founded by a king of violin-players, which reigned throughout
the seventeenth century, should have proceeded, first the dance-masters,
for reasons of independence, and then the organists and
clavierists, who actually maintained that a musician was he only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
who played an instrument with full harmony. The orchestra went
its own way, the “grande bande des violons” and the “petits
violons” of Lully’s time having laid the foundation. The clavier
was again the opponent of the orchestra, and concentrated the
whole body of tone in its keys. An intimate, personal interpreter
of musical emotions, it chooses to perform its functions in itself.
Its consciousness of its own importance grows to a height. No
longer will a clavecin-player when accompanist be the Cinderella
among a company of proud sisters. “The clavierist,” cried
Couperin indignantly, “is the last to be praised for his share in
a concerto. What injustice! His accompaniment is the foundation
of a building which supports the whole, and of which no one
ever speaks!”</p>

<h3>Scarlatti</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Domenico Scarlatti</span>, perhaps the greatest clavier-player that
Italy ever had, prefaces a collection of thirty sonatas, which
appeared at Amsterdam,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> with the following words: “Amateur
or professor, whoever thou art, seek not in these compositions
for any deep feeling. They are only a frolic of art, intended
to increase thy confidence on the clavier. I had no ambition
to make a sensation; I was simply requested to publish the
pieces. Should they be not utterly unpleasing to thee, I shall
all the more willingly undertake other commissions, in order
to rejoice thee in a lighter and more varied style. Take then
these pieces rather as man than as critic; so only shalt thou
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>increase thine own content. To speak of the use of the two
hands—D denotes <em>dritta</em>, the right, and M <em>manca</em>, the left.
Farewell!” It is noticeable how here in a few words the whole
essence of Italian clavier-music is summed up—the fresh, cheerful
disposition of the artist; the respect for the amateur; the
pleasure in mere sound and in musical construction; the thorough
working-out of intellectual motives (in the manner of the Étude);
and the stress laid upon the equal participation of both hands
as essential factors in the “concert,” [using this word in its older
sense as expressing the association of two or more vocal or instrumental
“parts”]. The word “concert” was well understood
in these early days to mean the combination of two viols;
and music of such a kind was, in form and in content, the true
precursor of clavier-music, in which the right and left hand
“parts” are strictly on an equality both in difficulty and importance.</p>

<p>These are the distinguishing marks of Italian clavier-art, and
within these limits it works.</p>

<p>But Scarlatti is especially remarkable to us in the present
day, in that he occupies the position of an early writer whose
pieces still play a part, though a small one, in modern public
concerts. Liszt, for example, was partial to him, and arranged
his “Cat’s Fugue”; while Bülow edited a representative selection
from his pieces. Czerny published (through Haslinger) two
hundred of his so-called Sonatas—though, by the way, the last
of these pieces belongs really to the father, Alessandro Scarlatti.
Before that time the remains of the master had formed no inconsiderable
part of private manuscript collections, such as those of
the Abbé Santini in Rome, and others.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Domenico Scarlatti, the famous son of the not less famous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>Alessandro, who was a composer of operas and chief of the
Neapolitan School, exhibits in old portraits a serious, severe,
even pedagogic countenance. There is also much of the pedagogue
in his pieces; yet I think him fresher, gayer, more happy
in life and mind than this face would lead one to suppose. His
“Exercises” move with vigorous strides, and are far too full of
esprit to be pedantic. His life was that of an artist universally
honoured, and rejoicing in his fame, a type of which his contemporary
Handel is the model; and his biography reveals no
less activity than his works. A pupil of his renowned father, in
the midst of the volatile, melody-loving, easily-stirred Neapolitan
world, he set out early for Rome, in order to become the scholar
of the great theorist Gasparini and of the organist and clavier-player
Pasquini. In 1709, at the age of twenty-six, he made
the acquaintance of Handel at Venice, and in sheer admiration,
followed him to Rome. There he remained ten years, and became
kapellmeister of St Peter’s, gaining a reputation by the works of
his genius. In 1720 we suddenly find him in London as clavicymbalist
of the Italian opera. Here his “Narcissus” was performed.
A year later again he was in Lisbon, where the King
of Portugal made efforts to detain him, and where for a time he
gave lessons to the Princess. At this time the fame of his playing
and of his compositions reached the farthest bounds of Europe,
and he ranked thenceforward as the first executant of the age.
He returned again to Italy, and from Italy to Spain. He remained
in Madrid from 1729 to his death in 1757. Here all kinds of
honours were showered upon him; he was Knight of St James,
and chamber-player to the Queen, who still retained a grateful
memory of the lessons he had given her at Lisbon when she
was Princess of Asturias. To her he dedicated his first-published
pieces, prefixing to them the lively preface above quoted.</p>

<p>Italian music has to French the relation which Bull has to
Bird, or the virtuoso to the poet. In Scarlatti we seek in vain
for any inner motive, nor do we feel any need of an emotional
rendering on the part of the performer; his short pieces aim only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
at <em>sound</em> effects, and are written merely from the love of brilliant
clavier-passages, or to embody delicate technical devices. They
are not denizens of Paradise, who wander, unconscious of their
naked beauty, under over-arching bowers; they are athletes,
simply rejoicing in their physical strength, and raising gymnastic
to a high, self-sufficient art. We admire them, as we
admire an acrobatic troupe of strong and stout character; we
admire them—not too much, yet with a certain eager anticipation
of the next interesting and unusual feat of skill. We wonder at
their mastery of technique, and the systematic development of
their characteristic methods; we rejoice that they never, in their
desire to please, abandon the standpoint of the sober artists;
but our heart remains cold. There is an icy, virgin purity in
this first off-shoot<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of absolute virtuosity, which kindles our sense
for the art of beautiful mechanism, for the art of technique <i lang="la">per se</i>—an
art which, after all, the historian of the clavier must not
depreciate by comparing it with that of the <em>inner</em> music.</p>

<p>The Scarlatti style is a genuine product of the Italian musical
emotion. The Italian is not born for heavy, contrapuntal, “vain
ticklings of the ears”; nor, on the other hand, for too intimate
effusions or symbolic mysteries. He is sensuous through and
through; delight in playing and in sound is the very life of his
music, as delight in outline and in colour is the very life of his
painting. The intoxication of absolute tone runs through the
masses of his churches, the operas of his theatre, the chamber-music
of his salons. Delight in sound gave the impulse to every
Italian musician in his bid for fame. It created virtuosity, which
loves playing for its own sake; it created the dramatic choruses,
with which the Venetian school began its career; it created the
melody predominating over the harmony, with the discovery of
which in the Florentine opera the greatest blow was struck for the
new principles of “secular” musicianship. From love of sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>the Venetians cast the instruments free from their old corporate
unity, and gave them an individual meaning and value. From
love of sound Frescobaldi led the organ, Corelli the violin, Scarlatti
the clavier, to undreamt-of technical creations. And the <i lang="fr">bel canto</i>
of the human voice almost attained the capacity of an instrument;
so small was the influence of the mere words. They were enamoured
of melody, which, unlike the ecclesiastical counterpoint,
sought its new objective not in the manifold transformation, but in
the natural development of a motive: they were captivated with
the “da capo” repetition of concerted pieces or arias, a habit
grounded on the psychological law of the higher effectiveness of
all repeated passages. They rioted in the multitude of forms, in
which they found a place for every kind of music, for every
“tempo,” every rhythm, and for all kinds of expression. Throughout
all this was to be perceived the sensuous Italian love for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
music, which expressed in this manifoldness
its freedom of artistic activity,
and in that freedom the unity of thematic
construction and consequently
the unity of formal repetition.</p>

<p>Technical ability was appreciated
in Venice earlier than elsewhere. The
registers of organists at St Mark’s go
back to 1318. In Venice not the
office only, but the art, was honoured.
The musician was not, as he was much
later at Florence, interrupted by the
ringing of a bell, if he continued his
performance too long. The emancipation of artists, which in
our own century we have seen carried out in the person of the
orchestral conductor, was in Venice effected by the instrumental
musician; and as to-day the orchestra has grown in repute
by the agency of the conductor, so in those days the prestige
of instrumental music advanced alongside that of the performer.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century a
Frescobaldi could already gain so important a position as player
of the organ and clavier, that it was said that no clavier-player
was respected who did not play after his new fashion.
When he gave his first recital in St Peter’s, thirty thousand persons
were there to hear him. What Frescobaldi was in the first
half of the seventeenth century, that was Pasquini in the second
half. In Italy, Austria, and France he was treated like a prince;
and his tombstone bears the proud inscription, “Organist of the
Senate and People of Rome.” With Scarlatti the art of clavier-playing
reaches its height, and begins to decline. It is not
clavierists but violinists, the wordless rivals of the singers, who
have carried the type of Italian virtuosity into our own times—Corelli,
Vivaldi, Locatelli, Tartini, Paganini.</p>

<p>This sensuous devotion to music apart from inner meaning,
this passion for poetic beauty, the Italians have not yet, even under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Wagnerian influences, wholly forgotten. The victorious rule of
absolute tone, while it constituted their greatness, carried with it
the germ of their decay. Virtuosity is the mark of their art
and of their life. We must take them as they are, in the whole
light-hearted temperament of their existence. This Bohemian
type of the Italian musician of the time may profitably be compared
with the similar French type. What a seductive brilliancy
there is in the adventurous career of a Bononcini! His operas
are received at Vienna with unparalleled enthusiasm. Queen
Sophia Charlotte is the clavier-player at the production of his
“Polifemo” in Berlin. In London he enters upon a contest
with Handel, in which social intrigues are involved with high
political aims. Next, he appears in a lawsuit, and is unmasked
as a common plagiary<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> of a madrigal of Lotti’s; shortly after
he is away to Paris with an alchemist, who swindles him of all
his property, and leaves him to make his living by the sweat of
his brow to his ninetieth year. Stradella’s fate is well known—how
he ran away with the mistress of a Venetian before the first
performance of his own opera;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was more than once attacked
with a dagger, and finally actually murdered.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> What, compared
with this, is the story of Rameau’s youthful love and its punishment,
and of his tardy attainment of the haven of fortune, or
what the anecdotes of Marchand, with his love affairs, his expulsion
from Paris, and his smiling return? The dangerous
glitter of this Italian Bohemianism is the fitting framework of
that sensuous, lively, irresponsible music.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the Italians should invent the opera—the
opera, in which every thing tends rapidly to the spectacular;
singers, scene painters, musicians, and the public. Apart from
its relation to opera all Italian music is unintelligible, and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>no accident that for centuries the Italians stood in the forefront
of opera. Those lucky misunderstandings are well-known, which
led, about the year 1600, to the rise of this form of art. A circle
of Platonic dreamers (led by Giovanni Bardi, Count of Vernio)
in Florence, anxious to revive the ancient tragedy, engaged
certain musicians to compose monodic songs with accompaniment.
They merely meant by this to be antique; but as a matter of
fact they were unconsciously acting along the line of the most
modern of needs, which had long tended towards isolated melody.
The dainty and delicate songs, which took their origin in this,
the Venetians, and afterwards the Neapolitans, accepted eagerly
as a material on which to construct forms of ravishing virtuosity,
until a Jomelli, with his dashing bravura passages on the most
solemn words, finally arrives at that very “laceramento della
poesia”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which the Florentine reformer Caccini had once fanatically
combated as a madness of the ancient song in several parts.
In a very short time the opera runs through the whole gamut
of the joys and sorrows of virtuosity. The sweet charm of sound,
exhibited by a voice which bears the melody, so suited to the
narrow outlines of poetry, is found in the old vestal airs of
Caccini and Peri. The delight in a multitude of forms, in an
alternation of different rhythms in short portions of the aria,
lived in the songs of the Venetian Cavalli, in which we are
reminded of the alternating tempi of the old instrumental pieces<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>—the
toccatas, fantasias, and canzoni. Yet empty vanity shows
itself all too soon. The original simplicity was overlaid by various
corrupt accretions, first by songs, introduced in loose dependence
on the action, then by complete concerted pieces, which are indicated
in the libretto—together with directions to tailors, architects,
and decorators, and alongside of the titles and orders of the
performers. In Naples, worse still, the music gradually declines
into a stiff and wearisome form and sweet playful nothingness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>The well-defined outline of the aria appears, now regularly written
“da capo”; it alternates to a tiresome degree with the accompanied
recitative; the chorus recedes into the background before
the soloists. It is the old typical form, skilfully adapted to
virtuosity, precisely as a sonata of Scarlatti is differentiated from
a toccata of Frescobaldi or Pasquini. Originality is vanquished;
elegance has created a set of formalities in which technique can
freely exercise itself. The substantive style, so to speak, has
given way to the adjective, and matter is conquered by form.
This Neapolitan class of opera, which thus exalts the virtuoso,
begins with Alessandro Scarlatti. He is the father of that species
of art which is afterwards included in the name of Italian opera,
in which we see a contempt for the words, a love of vocal bravura,
the supremacy of the aria, and a delight in the human voice as an
instrument. In the forms of his ornamentations we discover again
in antitype the passages of Domenico; in his love of the <i lang="it">da capo</i>
and instrumental repetitions of vocal phrases we see once more in
antitype Domenico’s repetitions of shorter or longer groups of
bars. In the “Alessandro nelle Indie” of the Neapolitan Leonardo
Vinci the hero sings arias full of slurred “divisions,” syncopations,
unprepared sevenths, which to a man acquainted with Scarlatti’s
sonatas appear to bear a strong family resemblance to Scarlatti.
Old rubbish bears germs of new creations; released from the heavy
burden of the words, the light play of the voices in the clavier-pieces

<p>The isolation of the voice and of the instrument, the sensuous
delight in sound, demands a chamber-music and a chamber-style.
Chamber-music demands the Maecenas of the great house, and the
wealthy amateur, who is so powerful a factor in every advance of
art. Roman musical life, for instance, draws its strength from the
practical encouragement of the Pope’s, or from the concerts and
operas performed in aristocratic houses. A Venetian nobleman,
Benedetto Marcello, became a distinguished and favourite composer,
a poet and a satirist. A Roman nobleman, Emilio dei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Cavalieri, became the founder of the modern oratorio, an opera-composer
of the advanced school, perhaps even the very earliest
composer of vocal monody. Vincenzo Galilei, the father of the
astronomer, became known by his monodies in that circle of
Florentine Platonists, to whose worthy amateurism is due the
origin of the opera; and he wrote a work on the technique and
fingering of all instruments.</p>

<p>Music in the home is in Italy not too intimate, but proud,
splendid, mere pastime. Like the opera of the virtuosos, like the
secularised church-music, it tends to rely upon effect, and lives on
applause. It depends chiefly on the performer, and knows little
of the mutual intelligence of souls. A subtle aristocratic love of
music runs through the Italy of the Middle Ages. Many are the
names of high-born men and women who had mastered the art
of the lute by ear—for a notation was as yet unknown.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In the
Decameron (1350), alongside of the novel-telling, it is song, lute-playing,
viol-playing, dance and choral refrain, with which that
pleasant company loves most to kill the time.</p>

<p>The music of dances, songs, and instrumental pieces, which
was soon to find its proper home in the clavier, is a child of
the world, and, in the view of a serious theoretician like Pietro
Bembo, it is exposed to all the dangers of emptiness and vanity.
In 1529 he writes to his daughter Helena, who like many of
the women in her position, intended to receive instruction on
the clavier in her convent: “As to your request to be allowed
to learn the monochord,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> I answer that you cannot yet, on account
of your youth, understand that playing is only suited for
idle and volatile ladies; whereas I desired you to be the most
pure and loveable maiden in the world. Also, it would bring
you but little pleasure or renown if you should play badly;
while to play well you would have to devote ten or twelve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>years to practice, without being able to think of anything else.
Consider a moment whether <em>this</em> would become you. And if
your friends wish you to learn to play in order to give them
pleasure, reply that you do not wish to make yourself ridiculous
in their eyes; and content yourself with the sciences and
domestic occupations.”</p>

<p>A hundred years later chamber-music is at its zenith. The
great Carissimi (d. 1674) put the flourishing chamber cantata<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>—that
half-dramatic, half-lyric song of the seventeenth century—by
the side of the monodic church-songs of Viadana; and
Steffani added his renowned chamber-duets. The case was precisely
similar with instrumental music; by the side of the “sonata
da chiesa,” with its free and independent style, came the “sonata
da camera,” as a suite of favourite dance forms;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the “concerti,”
with their several instruments playing to a small accompanying
orchestra. Above all, the possibility is now realised of
suitably accompanying monodies and concerted works on the
clavier, from the figured bass; and this in its turn contributes
not a little to the victorious advance of the melodic song. But
as a solo-instrument, the clavier suns itself in the light of the
chamber-style, in which brilliancy, dexterity of hand, and elasticity
of form are not less admired than the many small and
spirited caprices, which in the “grand” style of music have perhaps
not yet been attempted.</p>

<p>Among all the instruments of tone which achieve an independent
existence in Italy, the clavier naturally takes its stand
last. From its first movement towards this independence, in
Venice in the sixteenth century, to the full liberty of a Scarlatti,
stretches an interval of a hundred and fifty years. It was in
fact partly too much occupied in the orchestra, and partly too
dependent on the technique of the organ. We find it already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>in the orchestra in the first operas of Peri; under Monteverde,
the first of all great orchestral geniuses, there were two claviers,
on the right and left of the stage. They serve to accompany
solo singing, or, along with small organs, to fill up the harmony
of the orchestral body. As a rule the operatic composer writes
only the figured bass, but occasionally adds some of the melodic
voice-parts; the conductor completes the score, leaving to the
several players, however, a certain freedom of improvisation in
colouring, a freedom which a well-trained musician would not
abuse to the detriment of the <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>But clavier-pieces pure and simple had a characteristically
<em>dependent</em> existence. Even in that Venetian circle where Willaert
(1490-1563) Gabrieli,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and Merulo moved, in which instruments
were first emancipated, in which they were boldly introduced
into church-music, and solo-pieces were written for orchestral or
for keyed instruments, even here the soul of the clavier lay still
fettered. It is the organ that indicates colour and takes the
lead. In the pieces of the two Gabrielis, or of Merulo, the old contrapuntal,
pictorial fashion lives still almost untouched by external
disturbances; and the picture seldom allows us to anticipate that
stiff adherence to the theme, and that well-wrought harmony
which, in the England of the same age, we found so full of
promise. Down to the time of Frescobaldi, organist at St Peter’s
in 1615, who stands as a landmark in this development, the
Italian sense for absolute music is far too strong for an “applied”
music to be able, as it did in France and England, to <em>modernise</em>
the instrumental pieces by their necessary dependence on song
and dance. Canzoni<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> are treated in a light fugal style; the
so-called Ricercari<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> represent another and freer fugal form; the
toccatas, capriccios and fantasias are variegated attempts to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>unite all tempi and all kinds of playing in one piece. The
composers are aiming at typical forms, and only attain an unrestrained
formlessness which all these pieces with their trifling
differences alike exhibit. The juxtaposition of chords, successions
of canonic imitations, free alternations of tempo, piquant applications
of the newly-discovered chromatic possibilities—all these
interest these writers much more than character or expression.
All these ricercari, canzoni, fantasias, toccatas, are alike “sonatas”—pieces
which exist for the sake of their <em>tones</em> and technique,
and, as Couperin says, not in the least for the sake of their soul
or content. Dance-suites and variations on songs, which as time
went on gained in popularity, sharpened, here as elsewhere, the
sense for form; but these never became the predominant class.
The free form of the fantasia always ranked as the principal
species of the higher clavier-pieces. In Frescobaldi we already
see the process of crystallisation. His canzoni and fugues not
only exhibit for the first time the good fugal style familiar to
us, but also betray the modern sense for arrangement and method
in their frequent division<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> into three movements, and in their
progressive quickening of tempo. He it is also who reduces under
a distinct law of arrangement the various movements of the
whole instrumental fantasia.</p>

<p>With Pasquini in the second half of the seventeenth century, we meet
the visible line of demarcation between organ and clavier.
Hitherto the organ had been in everything the predominant
partner. The whole aspect of the clavier-pieces was that of the
organ. The old Venetians had frequently written for it in three
or four parts and brought the instrument into popularity. But
even Frescobaldi had written no piece for clavier alone. Diruta,
organist at Chioggia, the pupil of Merulo, wrote a dialogue
between 1597 and 1609 on the best method of playing organ
and clavier, and had of course drawn attention to the characteristic
features of clavier-playing; but all his observations on holding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>the hands horizontal,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on the good and bad fingers (the
second and fourth are the “good,” and fall on the strong accents
of the bar), or on the ornamentations and their execution, are
in the first instance written with reference
to the organ. Indeed, he
actually begins his book with a panegyric
on that instrument. As a matter
of fact the true emancipator of the
Italian clavier was Pasquini. He
wrote for the clavicymbal alone; in
his figures and style of play he
thus early showed a genuine sense for
the clavier; he abandoned the
practice of setting chord passages and
runs in close juxtaposition, but elaborated
out of the two the proper
clavier style; he brought into strong
connection with a theme the quicker
and slower parts of his sonatas, and
set them clearly over against each
other; and he attempts, as in his
Capriccio on the motive of the cuckoo’s
song, to draw from the clavier all kinds
of characteristic effects, still wild and
confused, but full of the freshness of
spring.</p>

<p>So far is the early Italian clavier
(when the violin begins its victorious
career) from assuming a leading position,
that the cembalo can do nothing
better than make use of the experiences
of the violin. For we must give up the
legend of the genius of Michel Angelo
Rossi. This story is one of the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>amusing freaks of musical history. We find in many popular
collections of old music an andante and allegro in G major by
this man, who is tolerably well known as an operatic composer
and violinist. He was a pupil of Frescobaldi and died in 1660.
This piece is so captivating in its melody, so decided in its form,
so restrained in its arrangement, that it would have done honour
to Mozart. Had these pieces truly sprung from the <i lang="it">intavolatura</i>
of Michel Angelo Rossi, the modernity of their form and melody
would give such a shock to musical history that it would be
shivered into fragments. Yet a man like Pauer, who published
them, could actually believe that this music was possible before
1660.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> A later historian, Rolland, in his “Histoire de l’Opéra
avant Lully et Scarlatti,” led astray by the same mistake, fancies
he detects in the choruses of Rossi’s opera of Hermione anticipations
of the Zauberflöte.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Parry alone, the author of the brilliant
article on the sonata in Grove’s Dictionary of Music, has boggled
at this pseudo Rossi. Heaven knows to whom the pretty little
pieces really belong. It is not unlikely that Scarlatti wrote
them in his old age.</p>

<p>The thematically precise sonatas and concertos of Corelli,
the old violin master; the pieces of Vivaldi, so wonderfully rich
in melody; the intellectual suites of Locatelli; it is in these
violin works that the form of the Italian instrumental piece first
appears, deriving itself from the joint experiences of the free
toccata and of the fettered dance. Corelli, who died so early as
1713, was one of those strange phenomena in the history of art,
which reach the utmost heights of an epoch, without freezing
into an icy classicism. His pieces are even to-day of a ravishing
sensuousness, and must be produced in the flowery dress of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>an improvised <i lang="it">coloratura</i>.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> They mark the highest point in the
monodic style of the virginal Italian music. From the point of
view of melody they are the freshest dances and arias written
about 1700, full of unparalleled invention and of a rhythmical
freedom which anticipates the scherzi of Beethoven. They are
indeed the works of a genius in form. But they never stiffen into
one shape, like the operatic overtures.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In Corelli the sonata still
stands in the full bloom of its manifold forms. Among his numerous
pieces there are not many which exhibit precisely the same
arrangement of the movements and of their tempi, or of the various
dances. Even the number of these movements varies, so that one
can lay down no precise rule. Slow movements begin, or stand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>in the middle, or come at the end; or even, with a modernised
reminiscence of old times, introduce themselves for a few bars<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
between the allegros and the vivaces. This is, from the point of
view of form, the same rhythmic freedom which Beethoven, on
deeper material grounds, reintroduced in his latest sonatas and
quartets. All is held together by an ornamental, delicate, and
thematic filigree-work. More rarely, as in the fourth Sonata
da chiesa and in the fifth Sonata da camera, a certain thematic
relation between the several movements is to be detected; but
within the movement the thematic conception is so worked out
that it is treated with natural modulations and appropriate intermediate
passages. The movement falls into two parts which
are repeated as a matter of course; the second part begins with
the modulated main motive of the first. Occasionally, as in the
allemande of the tenth concerto and in the allegro of the twelfth,
we find an exact return to the first theme. This combination of
the da capo system with the modulation of the theme; and in the
midst of this the miniature da capo system of the concerted violins
imitating each other; and especially the favourite concluding
repetitions of bars, alternating from forte to piano,—all these
became the groundwork of the Scarlattian style.</p>

<p>The da capo is in fact the scaffolding of this formal music.
To our modern minds it appears pointless; but in those days it
was natural enough. Some day the history of musical repetition
ought to be written; it would be indeed the history of quite half
of music. Even in Greek writings we meet melodic repetitions; it
is on the principle of imitation that the contrapuntal style of the
Middle Ages<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> is built; from the repetition of parts, or the
rearrangement of the themes, musical sentences become capable
of new effects; and further, there was the germ of progress in the
thematic conception of whole bars, whole groups of bars and whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>movements, which finally, whether arias or sonatas, were taken
da capo. This is the last step of thematic music which has shaken
off the contrapuntal forms. To-day we are in a period of repetition
which, for want of a better word, we may call “Thematic.”
In dependence on the old beginnings of programme-music, which
were greatly developed by Beethoven, the new <em>subjective</em> repetition
takes the place of the older. This new form works chiefly in the
<i lang="fr">idée fixe</i>, in the Leit-motiv, which is subtly treated and varied
according to the situations represented. Founded deep in the
essence of music, the principle of repetition has at all times been
an ever-changing, ever re-incarnating characteristic of the condition
of the tonic art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
It gave to the Italian sonata of its time the same character
of unity which the rhythm of the dance gave to the French
clavier-piece. But, before the separate movements could reach
their full formal development, the emancipation of the thematic
subjects from counterpoint, and their absolute self-dependence,
must be completed. The Italian ear, from its mere pleasure in
motive and its development, released the subject from obligatory
contrapuntal treatment. From the old thin forms of toccata
and capriccio sprang fugal exercises with poor and limited themes,
to which, so early as 1611, the old Francesco Turini gives the
sounding title of sonatas. They are full of the passages associated
with solo-instruments; they sound with flexible melodies;
they run off in the measured steps of the dance, and circle
round with repetitions of motives, groups, and movements. The
point which a Rameau, in his “Cyclopes,” attains by an extension
of the rondo-form—perhaps under the gentle influence of the
sonata—is reached by the Italian by formalising the free fantasia,
under the influence of the dance. It is <em>form</em> at which everything
on all sides aims.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>In Scarlatti’s sonatas we have very rarely more than one
movement; the two-movement groups of the sonatas, numbered
by Czerny 122 and 123, are exceptions. The pieces might be
combined into sonatas on the Corellian model but for the lack
of slow movements, which Scarlatti did not willingly write for
the brilliant and spirited clavier. The structure of the movements
displays that perfect freedom which still reigned in that
springtime of the age of musical form. If we are so inclined,
we may often detect, as in the prototype, a<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> first and a second
theme; but the signs of this later form of the typical sonata are
still so hidden that in many pieces we might, with equal justification,
detect five or six themes in the more melodious or decorative
passages. All is in transition, but the thematic conception is never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>left utterly in the background. The motives come out in apparently
reckless profusion, but scarcely one remains without its adequate
treatment. We observe all possible arrangements. Sonata 110
has a perfectly incongruous middle movement; in Sonata 111 a
moderato alternates with a presto, and both are repeated in
fuller elaboration. On the other hand some sonatas preserve
throughout the same rhythmical movement. As a rule the
second part of a movement concludes like the first, but in a
different key, just as it began like the first, but again in a
different key; or sometimes Part <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> begins with some different
motive from that of Part <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, or even with one absolutely new.
Usually the beginnings of both parts are somewhat stiff in
their thematic, while their later course is usually more free.
The development of a main motive—which in later times begins
the second division of a movement in sonata form—is as yet
confined to no definite part. Not rarely it is despatched in
the first part, as in Sonata 169, where the dactylic-trochaic
motive is so taken up, more or less decidedly, in the first part,
that only the very briefest reminiscence is left for the second.
The general construction is well illustrated in the eighth sonata—runs
of five semiquavers (<i lang="la">sic</i>) in A minor<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>—a fugal movement
proceeding in crotchets, diatonically rising and chromatically
descending—groups of diminished sevenths descending to C—conclusion,
the semiquaver motive again. Part <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>: the latter
motive modulating from C, through G minor to D minor, with
an insertion of the former figure in crotchets, developed as
in the conclusion of Part <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and returning from D minor to A
minor.</p>

<p>Formal structure is the be-all and end-all of the Italian
sonata. Technique is its very life. An inexhaustible brilliancy
and exclusive adaptation to the clavier is the characteristic of
Scarlatti. He has in his eye the thousand possibilities of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>clavier-technique, and throughout his pieces there breathes a glow
of enthusiasm which draws us easily from beginning to end
with the sweet grace of an irresistible rhythm. The successive
retardations, as in the arias of his father Alessandro’s Rosaura,
the changes of hands, the rivalry of concerted violins, the delight
in passages of quavers with thirds and sixths as their harmonic
accompaniment, such as is seen in the pieces of Corelli, long-sustained
notes with sudden leaps which seem to be derived
from the violin—all this is yet treated from the point of view
of the clavier, and, so to speak, new-born from it. There is
little song in Scarlatti, and a singing phrase is preferably
repeated with brilliant decorations; for the <i lang="it">leggiero</i> is much
better adapted to the spinet than the <i lang="it">arioso</i>. As a rule, both
hands roll on in a two-voiced exercise in pure and simple movement
without any additional encumbrance of heavy harmonies.
It is a spectacle of fireworks. Deep bass-tones are suddenly
introduced; high thirds fly off; thirds and sixths are darted in;
close arpeggios swell into monstrous bundles as they are filled
in with all possible passing-notes; octaves are vigorously introduced;
the hands steer in contrary motion, to one another,
away from one another; they are tied into chains of
chords; they release themselves alternately from the same
chords, the same groups, the same tones; unison passages in
the meanwhile run up and down; chromatic tone-ladders dart
through, then slowly moving phrases or still-standing isolated
treble notes are seen confusedly dotted over the changing bass
as it runs up and down, in a kind of upper pedal point; harsh
sevenths one after another; repeated notes, syncopated effects,
parallel runs of semiquavers with leaping side-notes, such as we
know so well in Bach; sudden interchanges from major to minor,
a device of which the Neapolitan operas are so fond; bold characterisation
by means of sudden pauses; startling modulations by
means of chromatic passages; embellishments rarely introduced;
a delicate arrangement of tones from the severest fugues to the
most unrestrained bourrées, pastorales, or fanfares—such is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
world of Scarlatti’s clavier-music. The “plucked” clavier (clavichord)<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
as yet does not admit of the delicacies of touch<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> which
delight us in the pianoforte; and its technique, too, will have to
consider the three main problems—how to arrange the musical
conception in the light and lively style suitable to the clavier, how
effectively to combine the two hands, and how to use the opportunities
which spring from the divided movements of the single
hand. These three problems—what the fingers can do, what the
hands can do, and what the clavier can do—are solved by Scarlatti
with all the readiness of his Italian temperament. His style
luxuriates in the liveliest crossings of the hands—a practice he is
said to have diminished as years increased his bodily dimensions;
and his ideas blossom out into a captivating, often eccentric
freshness, as, for example, in his fugal theme G, B♭, E flat, F sharp,
B♭, C sharp [D] (ascending), which he has taken as the foundation
of his best known and perhaps most splendid composition, the
Cat’s Fugue. Legend indeed asserts that these boldly combined
tones were suggested to him by a cat gliding along the keyboard.</p>

<p>The most distinguished names of those who have laboured
with success at the Italian clavier are those of Alberti,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> whose
preference for the skilfully broken chord-accompaniment has given
rise to the title “Alberti Bass”; Durante, who was dry, calculating,
and destitute of emotion; Galuppi, the graceful and courtly;
the somewhat superficial Porpora; the subtle Paradies; and
Turini, who is by far the most brilliant of all the Italian inheritors
of the mantle of Scarlatti. They take two or three movements for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>a work; they combine dance-pieces and sonata-pieces; they
pursue new melodic and rhythmic graces; but they all group
themselves around or after their hero, Domenico Scarlatti, who, as
first and greatest, has ushered in the pure Italian delight in sound
as voiced by the clavier.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

century, and can hardly have been accounted disgraceful, considering how frequently
Handel himself practised it, appropriating subjects of fugues, long passages, and whole

used for the keyed instrument, probably because the “German” clavichord had tangents
at the ends of the levers, which cut off the right length of the string, just as the moveable
“bridge” of the acoustician’s monochord of one single string does.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[61]</a> It is difficult to set the limits of what is possible in such matters; <i>e.g.</i>—John Jenkins
wrote a “Fancy” for three viols, before 1667, which modulates from F major through the
whole set of flat keys, up to G flat, whence he coolly turns a rather sharp corner home to F.
No one would have dared to suppose this possible.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a> This might well be. Compare the first phrase of the Recitative, which precedes
Dido’s dying song in Purcell’s “Dido and Æneas,” with the first phrase of Wolfram’s

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> The true origin of imitative counterpoint is almost certainly the <em>Rota</em>, what is
nowadays called a Round. This sort of infinite canon was already perfect in the thirteenth
century in England. No doubt the <em>Rota</em> itself was invented by an accident.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> The “first” and “second” subjects are often very clearly distinct in the binary
form of Scarlatti. The “second subject” is not a mere continuation of the “first”
in the subordinate key, as more generally it is in J. S. Bach, but it is another melody
altogether.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> The movement here described is apparently the “Presto” on page 25 of the
first volume of Mr Thomas Roseingrave’s edition of Scarlatti. The groups, so-called,
of “five semiquavers,” are of four descending semiquavers, followed by a crotchet,
making five notes altogether.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[69]</a> The action of all these keyed instruments, whether called virginal, spinet, clavecin,
clavichord, harpsichord, cembalo, is the same, namely, a “plucking” of the string by a
projection of quill or leather. The exception is the <em>German</em> clavichord, which was not
a keyed harp, but a keyed “monochord,” with key levers in connection with “tangents”
of metal, which sounded the string and cut off the right length of it at the same time.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> The <em>German</em> clavichord referred to in the note was able to produce a most delicate
effect of tremolo or repetition, called <i lang="de">Bebung</i>. This was possible simply on account of
the “tangential” action of the German instrument.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> Alberti rather deserves the title of an early “decadent.” His broken-chord
formula is mainly a way of avoiding trouble in writing real passages.</p>

<h3>Bach</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1717, when Scarlatti as yet dreamed not of his Spanish
renown, and shortly after Couperin’s first little pieces had appeared,
the Parisian clavecinist Marchand made a journey to
Germany. At the Polish court of Dresden he created a furore by
his playing, and a famous contest was the result, got up, as it
appears, by intrigue, between Marchand and an organist of
Weimar, Johann Sebastian Bach. The King was present in
person. Marchand began by improvising variations on a French
song, and was loudly applauded. Bach then took the same
theme, but varied it twelve times over so marvellously that without
further contest he carried off the palm from his famous
adversary, who, when Bach proposed a competition on the organ,
incontinently fled from Dresden.</p>

<p>Who was this Bach, and what was this sudden development of
German music? Hitherto not much had been heard of it in foreign
countries, and on looking at the German tablatures<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of the older
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>time one could only recognise an honourable but somewhat clumsy
struggle. In the sixteenth century, perhaps when, in wider circles,
some mention was made of the great vocal compositions of Isaac
and Senfl, a certain Nürnberger, Hasler by name, proposed himself
to Gabrieli in Venice as a pupil, and later his renown was heard at
the courts of Vienna and Dresden. In the next century another
German, Johann Jakob Froberger, was associated with Frescobaldi
in Rome, and his fame also was afterwards heard at the Viennese
court. He cannot have been unpopular, for a number of anecdotes
clustered round his name. Froberger, and with him Pachelbel of
Nürnberg, began the emancipation of the clavier in Germany. In
the Hanse Towns of the north were good organists, such as Buxtehude
in Lübeck and Reincke in Hamburg; but no one in Italy or
France troubled himself with them.</p>

<p>The fame of Italian sonatas and French suites was such a
matter of course, that the Leipzig organist, Kuhnau, when he in
1700 published his collections of genuinely German clavier-pieces,
plumed himself mightily, in his chatty prefaces, on the fact that
now at last, even in Germany, good music was to be had, which
could take its place by the side of the foreign. “Even in Germany,”
he exclaimed, “oranges and citrons at last bloom!” The excellent
Kuhnau ventured to give the title of sonata to a piece on the
model of the Italian sonata da camera, although it was written not
for violin but for clavier. Hence it is often said that he was the
creator of the clavier-sonata. But this piece has nothing in
common with the later popular composition of that name; it was
a cento of several movements in various tempi, as the suite was a
cento of several dances. Nay, the Cyclopes of Rameau stands
nearer to the later type than this. The suites and sonatas of
Kuhnau are pure clavier-pieces, somewhat marred by the usual
failings of youth, and running every theme to death, but clear,
vigorous, and adapted to the fingers, smooth in feeling and modern
in technique. But the most curious work of Kuhnau is his “Biblical
Histories.” Here he illustrates on the clavier all kinds of
Scriptural stories, like the death of Goliath, the cure of Saul, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
marriage of Jacob, Hezekiah’s recovery, the life of Gideon, and
Jacob’s death, in sonata-form, on the model of the programme-music<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
of the time, and with the assistance of verbal elucidations.
Yet Kuhnau is as little as Froberger or anyone else a forerunner
of Bach, who so overshadows the work of his predecessors that one
may almost say he is independent of them.</p>

<p>It is indeed hard to compare Bach even with the other
wonders of the history of art. For there is scarcely one who is so
identical with his art as is Bach with music. A Michel Angelo
does not include a Rembrandt, nor a Rembrandt a Monet; but in
Bach there is a Beethoven, a Schumann, a Wagner. I believe that
if the Almighty had wished to offer to men in sensible form what
at that time was called music, he would then have given them the
work of Bach. In it there are the deepest secrets of musical polyphony,
as well as the most intense degrees of decadent expression;
the mysticism of the Middle Ages is there no less than the perspective
of the future. But content and form are not dissociated
as they are in history; they are identical, they are one and the
same, as they are in the philosophic concept of music. Once, and
perhaps once only, in this world has the “Thing in Itself” been
realised, and the difference between concept and actuality been
reduced to nothing. The history of music can be written with
almost exclusive reference to Bach. We might show how it has
converged towards him and again diverged from him in search of
its special partialities. We might point out how it revolves round
him, comes to him, and goes from him in the course of the
centuries, just as in the case of the imitative arts we show that they
come from Nature and go to her.</p>

<p>Bach’s life was the most uneventful conceivable. He made no
journeys to Rome and Paris; he learned musical literature by
studying and copying. A true “Old Master,” he sits with his
serious, almost severe countenance, in the midst of his large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>family of twenty children, all musical, and composes for instruction
or for his own pleasure, without seeing many of his compositions
printed. His renown had no wide extent;<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> his bold
extravagances aroused only that hostility which does not bring
honour, and in his successive posts at Arnstadt, Weimar, Köthen,
and Leipzig, he had little opportunity for sunning himself in the
rays of princely favour. A single moment of his life perhaps
stands out prominently, when Frederick the Great at one of his
concerts received the list of strangers in Potsdam, and interrupted
the playing to say to his officers, “Gentlemen, old Bach has
arrived.” He was instantly summoned, and, in his travelling
dress as he was, improvised on a theme of the King’s, which,
when completed and published, he dedicated to the King as
“Musikalisches Opfer.” When two great men meet, the whole
world feels the electric shock.</p>

<p>With the appearance of Bach the whole history of music turns
to Germany. And clavier-music, so far as it has a particular
meaning, is henceforth German. England, France, and Italy, sink
either gradually or suddenly into the background.</p>

<p>Bach’s clavier-music is a complete world, a mirror of his music
as a whole. As Nature is her whole self in every leaf, so in every
piece or group of pieces Bach is the whole Bach. Thus for the
first time it came about that the clavier became capable of
interpreting the whole nature of a great man. With the early
Englishmen it was the embodiment of the whole tone-poet; with
Couperin the whole man, indeed, but a man who was nothing but
a dancer; with Scarlatti a whole clavier-player; but with Bach
the whole nature of a man of whom it is impossible to say whether
the musician or the intellect in him was the greater. This was the
first outstanding peak attained by the clavier.</p>

<p>The natural creative principle from which Bach works, that
which gives unity to his being, is the conception of counterpoint.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>Music can be written in which every
single voice is treated as an independent
line, and in which the art of
combining these lines reaches the
highest possible development, as in
a picture of Holbein—and this is
counterpoint. Or music could be
written, in which an upper melody,
clearly illuminated, runs on an advancing
basis of accompanying harmony
without much attention to purity of
voice, as in a work of Ribera—and
this is the style resting on “accompaniment.”
Bach’s essence lies in
the contrapuntal method. He conceives
the voices <em>over against</em> one another; and at the very
moment in which he interjects a motive, there is a second or
third motive introduced, embracing the other in contrapuntal wise.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>Yet he has taken the accompaniment-style also into himself.
Just as little as he can ever be censured for defect in melody, so
little has he ever neglected the newer “secular” harmony—rather,
he has carried on his counterpoint in accordance with its laws.
He has of course as little respect as any other first class musician
for the common Italian accompaniment with its singing melody
alone. If he adopts it, it is in very discreet fashion; the richly
decorated arioso soaring above the vigorously moving <i lang="it">basso continuo</i>
in such delicate arrangement that we think rather of an
ornamented contrapuntal passage than of a light singing voice
accompanied by the cembalo with <em>figured</em> bass.</p>

<p>In this secularisation of counterpoint by means of the contrasting
features of an arioso, the foundation of a bass, and the
modern system of a network of harmony, he exhibits the characters
of both musical styles in one, and gives us the unification of two
epochs, which necessarily opened a boundless prospect into the
future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
Two or more voices running alongside are treated in their
relation to one another. Here the simple contrapuntal exercise,
which sets them neatly together, and enfolds their rhythms into
each other, will soon cease to satisfy. The best-sounding contrapuntal
relations are those in which the voices show some slight
traces of imitation. From the lighter imitations rises the stricter
canon,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and at last the exact and regular succession of canonic
repetitions is reached. The ideal is then an exercise in which
every note of every voice has its imitative relations, and in which
the whole is so interconnected that not a stone can be removed
without bringing about the fall of the whole structure.</p>

<p>We see Bach himself at this work. He works more lightly and
elegantly, or more heavily and massively, not by arbitrary choice,
but according to his subject. He begins with a Prelude, in which
a gentle interlacing of voices answers to his mood; imitations,
arising as if of their own accord, are inserted here and there.
Then there is the final gigue of a suite, in which a rapid 6/8 theme
has to be treated, in spite of its rapidity, with a certain canonic
severity, which gives solidity to the conclusion of the whole suite.
Then again we have a slow movement of intertwining voices, such
as is found after the first preluding bars of the F sharp minor and
C minor Toccatas; the voices alternately take up the mournful
themes, with no strict regularity of exact succession, wonderfully
floating, according to a fixed purpose, and gently swimming in
their harmonies, with no recognisable support, almost a fairy-like
echo of mediæval counterpoint. Or, finally, there is a regular
fugue, which stands there like a monument, with hardly a superfluous
note; in regular succession the voices present the theme in
single or double counterpoint, always alternately imitating at the
fourth or fifth, with a never-failing reference to the tonic key;
and near the close, where still greater closeness of imitation is
demanded, proudly and stiffly vaulted over with diminutions or
augmentations of the theme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Bach has left us clavier-works in which we see perfected the
simplest form which the contrapuntal conception could assume in
his hands. These are the fifteen “Inventions” and the fifteen
“Symphonies,” which in the manuscript appear with the inscription,
“Straightforward directions, by which the amateur of the
clavier, but especially the one anxious to learn, is shown a plain
method, not only of playing properly in two parts, but also, on
further progress, to undertake three <a id="chg2"></a>obbligato parts; at the same
time also not only gaining good inventions, but also personally
performing them, and, above all, attaining a cantabile style in
playing, as well as a good foretaste of composition.” This curious
preface ends, “Verfertiget von Joh. Seb. Bach, hochf. Anhalt-Cöthenischen
Capell-meister, Anno Christi 1723.”</p>

<p>The simple homeliness of the time speaks in this title-page;
and it is well to appropriate to-day as much of this as possible, in
order to lose nothing in the enjoyment of these fifteen two-voiced
Inventions and these fifteen three-voiced Symphonies. Even to-day
Bach demands the desire of learning in amateurs, who should
feed their pleasure with diligence, and enter into the feelings of the
composer. One who sits at the clavier with a zeal worthy of
Bach’s compositions, will find in these thirty simple contrapuntal
pieces a small storehouse of treasures. He will be captivated by
the elegance of this canonic music as soon as his fingers are able
to play in parts; but he will never be released from the influence
of the many-coloured glittering character of these compositions.
They are the drawings of a master, which in a few strokes depict
great objects; sketches of a great artist, so full of scholarship that
they cover the whole of life. The solemn Invention in F minor,
the eccentric one in B flat major, the Symphony which sounds so
mournfully in E flat major, or the chromatically gloomy F minor,
the sprightly staccato G minor, the graceful A major whose traces
are to be found in so many works of a later time, and the rhythmical,
freely-singing B minor, with its harp-like strokes, in which
Beethoven and Chopin, yet unborn, seem to meet—these pieces
were then unique in literature, and still remain so.</p>

<p>In these fantasy-pieces the fugal conception is dealt with on
a small scale; in the Toccatas on a large scale. The clavier-toccatas
of Bach are free pieces of that wonderful many-sidedness
of construction which a music might still possess that had not
yet stiffened into conventionalism. When we sit down to play
the Inventions and Symphonies, we point our fingers as if for
miniature work. But when we sit down to the Toccatas, we
dispose our arms and hands, as would have been said in Bach’s
time, “in einer gewissenen grossartigen Freyheit,” with a certain
large freedom. These Toccatas will be eternal favourites, because
of their air of improvisation which develops the fughetta out of the
preludic movement, and scatters the playful, pleasant technique
in the midst of the severities of imitation. Inexhaustible in the
apparent formlessness of their form, they stand on the threshold
of modern literature as the great models of that true clavier-style
which will always have a touch of the extempore as one of its
characteristic features.</p>

<p>In the Toccatas it can be seen how Bach permits his fugal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
conceptions organically to grow. It is in them that we see the
psychology of the fugue more purely than in the strictest formal
fugal movements. Take, for example, the F sharp minor Toccata.
Here the fingers preludise over the keyboard, gradually growing
slower, the passages differentiate themselves into motives, which
gently imitate each other, until at length they come to rest on
a solid bass. This is the moment of lyric inspiration; and the soul
sighs itself out in a slow movement, which weaves itself in fugal
style, speedily sweeping forth in its own free, harmonious woven-work.
A staccato-motive breaks in; rolling semiquavers soon
crystallise around it; it grows and swells in a three-voiced fugue;
loosens itself, becomes lighter, and passes off into an operatic
joyousness, circling round in repetitions, which to us seem almost
too wide for the narrow significance of this motive. A pause, and
in the new-won freshness emerges the first chromatic adagio-motive
as a lively floating fugue, soon breaking forth into four voices, and
ending in a stirring finale.</p>

<p>Take the D major Toccata. Here there is a joyous prelude
of ascending scales, running off in chords and tremoli. An insertion
of a fresh capriccioso motive follows, which pursues its course
mingled with playful figures. A pause in adagio; mournfully
moving melodies, freely accompanied by tremoli; softly passing
over into a quiet three-voice fugue, which again leads to preluding
passages, speaking recitatives, broken chords, till the great wild
hunt of triplets surges in its fugal power. This D major piece
is in content and technique Schumann all over.</p>

<p>Similarly, one easily recognises the development of soul in the
solemn C minor Toccata, which is dominated almost throughout
by a charmingly-constructed fugue; or in the D minor Toccata,
with its stirring and beautiful adagio-movement; the G minor
with its bacchanalian finale; the rapid G major; and the never-to-be-forgotten
E minor with its clearness and restraint. They
are all built up on an inner meaning, and show a grandeur in
their intimate nature such as only Beethoven has dared to express
on the clavier, and a soulfulness never surpassed by a programme-musician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
in our century in his own style. But the fugue has in
them become the indwelling soul, and the whole speech of music
has absolutely ascended into their form. We see it come, grow,
and depart.</p>

<p>One who has investigated the psychology of Bach’s fugue in
the Toccatas, will no longer fail to recognise it in his pure and
absolute fugues. A fugue of Bach—this sounds to the <em>lay</em> musical
ear as the very sum of all that is academic. But in reality never
were fugues written which were developed less academically, or
which flow so entirely from the soul. Only take the fugal form not
as the end in itself, and not as a mere example of musical architecture—only
take pains to discover the spirit of its unfolding—and
we shall be astounded at the endless variety of the inward musical
life which is profusely showered into this form. The essence of
a fugue of Bach is just this freedom from all architecture, this
suppression of all calculation in favour of the spiritual development.
The fugal form, that well-known series of enlargements
and arrangements of the pure canon, is to him a prime <i lang="la">datum</i>,
from which, nevertheless, he has formed no unbending principle.
But he works with this material in such a way that he keeps the
development of a piece always subordinate to the character which
the fugal theme imposes on him. The theme is the title, the piece
the contents.</p>

<p>His genius reveals itself in perception of the thousand possibilities
of unfolding which lie in his themes—some advancing
diatonically, some studded over with pauses, some with sudden
stops on sevenths, some marching on in massive choral style,
some humorously staccato, especially those with startling false
accents, others drawn in large outlines which excite curiosity and
scarcely stand forth in their clear rhythm till the ninth or tenth
bar, and which he was so fond of because they gave the strongest
stimulus to the coming development.</p>

“Wohltemperiertes Klavier” displays, or which is shown in the
C sharp minor fugue, with its three themes gradually stratified
one above the other, or rolling themselves off with that extraordinary
ease which we daily admire in the famous A minor—this
kind of fugue is a necessary speech of music: it is melody,
it is a natural language which can never disappear. To grasp
it, to assimilate it, until the many voices or even many themes
of its development stand clearly before our eyes in their full
characteristic value, is a feast for the musical epicure to which
hardly anything else can be compared. Bach’s fugues are <em>playable</em>.
They are not too easy; but they are so in the spirit of the clavier
that the fingers soon lose their timidity, and the work is as a
mirror in which they speedily recognise the necessary nature of
their motion. And there is an eternally fresh animation in this
activity, in which no deception, no dilettantism, no superfluity
can exist for a moment.</p>

<p>The great artist, to whom the “Fantasy” is a presupposition,
does not work on it, however much it may seem to the crowd a
chief aim; he works on the form which requires this kind of work.
We see Bach, through his whole life, labouring at the fugue; and
the encyclopædic work, in the midst of which he died, “The Art
of Fugue,” shows us heights of power in this form which make us
dizzy. Besides certain scattered fugues, he has made a collection
of different periods in the two volumes of the “Wohltemperiertes
Klavier.” Here every major and minor mode of every semitone is
doubly treated, with a prelude and fugue—a comprehensiveness of
arrangement which was partly due to the taste of the time,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>partly can be referred to the secondary aim of the work, which
was the introduction of a system of clavier-tuning which should
be sufficient for practical purposes, in which no acoustic solecisms
should be committed to suit convenience, and in which all the
keys should be used indifferently and in their completeness by
pupils. It is not hard to detect that the unity of these two
volumes is not very complete. Even Spitta, a meritorious but
somewhat tasteless biographer, who seeks to find the “higher”
unity in all Bach’s works, is compelled to grant that there are
varieties of style and intrusions of alien matter in the “Wohltemperiertes
Klavier.” But that is no loss. The brilliant many-sidedness
of its contents can support even this discontinuity of style
(which, by the way, is but a slight discontinuity) and this artistic
fusion of certain preludes and fugues, which originally were not
composed with a view to each other. No one will fail to perceive
how wonderfully the preludes combine with each other and with
many of the fugues. The whole, perhaps, gains something of the
character of the old composite epics, such as Homer or the Bible.
Bach’s autograph of the first part bears the date 1722; there is no
complete autograph of the second part, and this Bible of clavier-playing
was first printed in 1800, two or three generations after its
production.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>If we look at the original editions of the six works which were
printed in Bach’s time, they speak in no uncertain tone of the taste
of the age. From 1726 to 1730 appeared the “Klavierübung”—the
first part, with the suites which are known as “Partiten.” In
1735 we have the second part of the Klavierübung, containing
the Italian Concerto and the “Ouverture nach französischer Art”
(also a suite). In 1739 appeared the third part, in which are
found organ chorales along with four duets for two claviers.
In these the distinction between organ and clavier is as feebly
marked as it always was before the invention of the pianoforte.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>The fourth part, which appeared in 1742, contains the great
Variations for clavicymbal with two keyboards. Besides these,
in 1747 appeared the “Musikalisches Opfer,” in which the theme
of Frederick the Great is elaborated; and, in 1752, two years
after Bach’s death, was published the “Kunst der Fuge.” He
could only venture on the printing of the “Kunst” in his later
years, when the Bach fugue had made some way in the world.
The “Musikalisches Opfer” came out under the protection of
the King; all the other clavier-pieces which seemed to him
likely to pay for the printing are of a lighter kind—suites and
concertos “for the delight of amateurs,” as it stands on the
title-page. The three types of the great Bach counterpoint—the
miniature Invention, the free Toccata, and the absolute
Fugue—then, as now, appealed to too select a circle to attain
the popularity of dances and concertos.</p>

<p>If Bach’s greatness is in the former works stupendous, in
the latter it is loveable. Here we learn to know his other side.
It is his “other manner.” Here, instead of the severe canonic
development of a theme, attention is paid to the voices as parts
of a harmonious whole; he steps down from the cothurnus, and
moves familiarly in pleasant comedy. Still, the contrapuntal
conception is the basis of the structure; but simply harmonised
floriations of melody are interwoven, so that the clavier almost
rivals the arioso of a violin. Between the extremes of the first
movement of the “Chromatic Fantasia,” with its free rhythms,
arpeggios, recitatives, and song-passages, and of the second movement,
the regular fugue—extremes which mark the two limits
of Bach’s style—there is an endless abundance of methods of
treatment, in which now the contrapuntal element and now the
arioso takes the lead. We see Bach in this second group of his
clavier-works, the suites and concertos, pass over into the enchanting
fields of Italian sensuous music. But it is remarkable how
he never loses for a single moment his unique depth and his
insatiable delight in form. There is a very abyss between a
suite of Bach, founded on the Eternities, and one of Handel’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
owing its popularity to the transitory charms of dexterous
trivialities.</p>

<p>There are three great groups of Bach’s clavier-suites: the
so-called Partiten, which appeared in print in his own life-time,
the “English Suites,” and the “French Suites.” The Partiten,
which were first published separately, must, as the earliest work
of this author known to the public, have struck the whole world
with bewilderment. It was the first bound of a unique genius,
the elevation of a traditional form of art into quite unparalleled
shapes, a storm of intellectual lightning in a region long regarded
as exclusively owned by Frenchmen and Italians. Even to-day
the Partiten belong to the most select class of clavier-literature;
and I cannot for a moment conceive how they are not to be
regarded as superior by many degrees to the English and
French suites. In no book is the future of music more clearly
foretold. To see in the B flat major corrente, Chopin; in the
B flat major gigue, Schumann; in the C minor sinfonia, Beethoven;
in the C minor Rondo and Capriccioso, Mendelssohn; in
the A minor Scherzo, Mozart, is no mere enthusiastic fancy.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The Partiten outgrew the ordinary scheme of the suites
(allemande, corrente, saraband, gigue) as Beethoven’s sonatas
outgrew the old scheme of sonatas. They have given a new
life and a new spirit to a traditional form. The suite, which at
the end of the seventeenth century has become merely conventional,
is so elevated by the spirit of Bach that it thenceforward
stands in the world of actuality. Even Schumann selects a
similar form for the expression of modern emotions. The suite
having been thus despatched, the sonata is in similar fashion put
into precise and regular form, to be transfigured later by Beethoven
with the same modern spirit. Bach had the fortune and
the genius to relegate the traditional suite into the past, and to
see the conventional sonata dawning in the future. Thus with
him the dance-piece and the free piece remained fresh and lively.
Suite and sonata were only different external ways for reducing
several pieces to unity. There, men took their stand on the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
familiar series of dance-tunes, without ever thinking of the dances
themselves; here, they found for the first movement a practical
form, and, in the event, ranged the adagio, scherzo, and rondo
together, just as their predecessors had used the saraband, minuet,
and gigue. On this tendency to unity on the part of the clavier-pieces,
from the first English variations, through Couperin’s Ordres,
to Bach’s suites, Italian sonatas and German sonatas, Chopin’s
Albums, Schumann’s Scenes, Liszt’s Epics, too much stress need
not be laid. Even more than the orchestra, the clavier leans to
short pieces, but the intellect demands some excuse for binding
them together.</p>

<p>If we take a striking liveliness as the characteristic of the
Partiten, we indeed find a feature in which they are distinguished
from the French Suites, but which is far from exhausting their
qualities. Solid melodies, humorous capriccios, enchanting
dances, tuneful airs, everything is included in these works. In
their pages we realise how the spirit of Bach strives to utter the
very utmost of which it feels itself capable. And in these introductory
preludes, toccatas, or symphonies, in these flowing allemandes,
gliding correntes, heavy sarabands, filigree-worked gigues, in those
numerous intermezzo movements, such as burlesques, rondos, airs,
minuets, and passepieds, there are turns of genius, the form of
which is impressed for ever on the mind. I think of the sweet
running movements of the astonishing B flat major Gigue; of the
brilliant structure of the C minor Capriccio, which concludes the
Partita in place of a Gigue; of the D major aria, in which breathes
the whole grace of the eighteenth century; of the bold and rhapsodical
Saraband in D major; of the rich colouring of the introductory
E minor Toccata; the rocking melody of the allemande,
the sombre glow of the saraband, the wayward syncopations of
the gigue.</p>

<p>The six English Suites, which we may certainly assume to
have been put into juxtaposition by Bach himself, stand between
the six printed Partiten and the six French Suites, whose combination
was only probably, not certainly, due to Bach. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
would seem to have been called “English” suites, because they
were arranged for some Englishman; the original title was
apparently “suites avec prélude.” For the English suites, like
the Partiten, have each a fairly long introduction, fugal in style,
but not conforming to the strictest laws of the fugue. The intermezzi,
also, are as numerous as in the case of the Partiten. But
that extreme intellectual severity is wanting; they are more
graceful and polite. This character is especially noticeable in the
introductory fugal movements and the intermediate dance pieces;
and one who seeks rather a play of tone than grandeur of soul will
perhaps find here a richer yield than in the Partiten. Neat,
volkslied-like sarabands, ravishing bourrées, rococo gavottes,
ornamental minuets, the exquisitely delicate passepied in E minor—these
all lie so thick one on another, that one cannot recall a
more sparkling album of dainty dances in the whole eighteenth
century. It is true that in the Vienna school (as in the case of the
younger<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Muffat and others) there is in this class of dances a gentle
soothing quality, which gives us the first hint of the coming
beautiful Viennese dance-music; but they are, like those of
Handel, too short in duration and too featureless for us to be able
to return to them with the extraordinary affection with which we
return to those of Bach. These are so rich in invention that they
cannot in many centuries lose their flavour. The dancing underpart
of the D major gavotte in the D minor suite, the multiform air
of the D minor, E minor, and A minor sarabands, the filigree-counterpoint
of the E minor Passepied, the extreme daring of
the A minor bourrée, the transport of the A minor prelude, which
even grows into a roundelay,—what a depth of originality is there
in all these pieces, in which the repetitions so wonderfully satisfy
the laws of the mind without becoming mechanical!</p>

<p>How the French Suites came by their name is hard to say.
More French than the English suites they are certainly not, for
they are quite as Bach-like as the latter. Without Preludes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>without too many Intermezzi or “Doubles” (repetitions with
variations), they are of astonishing variety. The Allemandes
especially, as first movements in every suite, display such a
manifoldness of form, that in fact nothing is left in common to
them but the four-time beat. The song in the Saraband and the
dance in the Intermezzi appear to the same effect as in the English
suites, and a light tone runs through the whole. But the tone
is lightest of all in the E major suite, which with its rolling
allemande and courante, its singing saraband, its stiff and formal
gavotte, its characteristic polonaise, its tricksy bourrée, and its
cheerful gigue, is a perfect paradise of dainty devices. The flowing
courante in it strikes our fancy; for it is precisely in the courantes
of these suites with their heavy old-fashioned movements that we
shall most often hit on the rare occasions on which we must regard
Bach as already obsolete. The ornamentations tend to appear
less befitting to us, scattered so profusely as they are in these
movements. But to Bach, little as he could as yet succeed in
emancipating himself from ornamentations, they were no longer such
a matter of course as with the old French clavecinists. If we compare
the different manuscripts of his works, we see the uncertainties
and alterations. Bischoff, in his excellent critical edition of Bach’s
clavier-music (Steingräber) has therefore only engraved large those
ornamentations which were without doubt always played by Bach.
Taste will fill them in in certain places on grounds of symmetry
and “thematic”; but they are no longer bewildering in their
profusion.</p>

<p>Among the suites which do not belong to these collections,
we recollect with great pleasure the dainty dances and intermezzi—for
example in the E flat major suite, and especially that in
B minor with overture in French style (Largo—Fuga—Largo)
which appeared in the second part of the Klavierübung as a piece
for two manuals. It presents, among the many intermezzi, a
gavotte in the style of the orchestral Partiten, which links itself
with the choicest dances, in graceful style, of the preceding century.
From the clavier-suites we pass to the clavier-sonatas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
which, still in the style of Italian art, mingled with dances, offer
free combinations of different movements. The melodious andante
of the D minor sonata, and its final allegro-movement rattling off
almost in one part, are perfect pearls. A step further we reach
the fantasias with fugues; especially the polyphonic one in A
minor, the recitatival “Chromatische” and the concerto-like C
minor, fugally treated, but still not a fugue. These three fantasia-pieces
were Bach’s direct bequests to the future. In the polyphony
of the brilliantly rushing fantasia in A minor, rising with endlessly
delicate melody, we are reminded of the “Meistersinger”; in the
chromatic fantasia, with its broad narration and grandiose concluding
pedal point, the clavier seems to us to speak with the
freedom of a drama; in the significantly constructed C minor
fantasia rests the whole formal talent of the instrumental composers
of the expiring eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The three “brilliant” fantasias incline naturally to the concerto
style, which partly abandoned counterpoint in favour of a
mere accompaniment, and partly subordinated it to the careful
elaboration of a single voice-part. The problem of committing
a whole concerto to the clavier alone, Bach has solved in his
famous “Italian Concerto”—Italian in the conception of the style
of execution proper to concertos, which in Italy developed itself
specially on the violin—Italian in the form of a slow movement
enclosed by two quicker movements, which had emerged as the
most practical method for the violin (half in rivalry with the
Tutti, half in the interest of solo virtuosity). Bach has in the
Italian concerto perfectly attained the object of writing in several
movements a clavier piece fit for execution. The grand
sonatas of a later time have been able to add nothing essential
to it. The first movement is an ingenious combination of pregnant
motives, which reminds us of tutti-effects, of running semiquaver
figures, and melodious passages on moving quaver accompaniment,
which correspond to the second lyrical theme of sonatas.
The slow movement is a great recitative song with a berceuse-like
accompaniment, of a structure so delicate that we are irresistibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
reminded of the contours of old primitive pictures. It has the dainty
grace of archaic outline, just like that in the two-part interwoven
arioso<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of the B minor Prelude, or in the crisp melody of the
E flat Prelude (Wohltemperiertes Klavier <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>). The third movement,
which is quicker, unravels the whole into the cheerful linked
play of floating parts, unsurpassed in elegant construction by any
of the great formalists. Floating passages run up and down
among chords, falling like drops of rain, and the voices combine
in pleasant unity.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The entire multiformity of music at the beginning of the
eighteenth century is expressed in the clavier-works of Bach.
As yet the sonata-form with its two themes, and its “free”
section in the middle of the movement, has not become the consecrated
scheme;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and all the forces which had gradually worked
towards this form exert themselves unfettered, in order to make
themselves effective now in this, now in that combination of
movements and parts of movements. “Thematic” is not neglected.
To a series of suite-movements similar commencing motives are
given, and the motives of earlier parts are taken up in the later.
But this tendency to unity does not act as a restraint upon form,
and does not reduce everything to one stiff mould. There is a
fugue with a prelude, by Bach, that in E flat major (Wohltemp.
Kl. i.), which offers perhaps the most delicate example of this unrestrained
unity of motive. The Prelude, which is much longer than
the fugue, begins with semiquaver figures, whose characteristic is
melodious sustained passages advancing by sixths and sevenths;
after this introduction, begins in toccata-fashion a kind of slow
fugue, which unfolds the just heard motive in a terser form; and
finally, in a third part, mingles itself with the former semiquaver
figure. The fourth part is so to speak moulded in the fugue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>form, which in its “subject” makes use of the characteristic leap
of a seventh, found in the Prelude, as a main feature, and brings
the play to a conclusion in a busy and lively manner. The
relations of motive are only to be <em>felt</em>, not seen; but they are
<em>there</em>, and give to the formal freedom of this piece a vigour of
its own. Thus, in many of Bach’s pieces, apart from the direct
thematic motives, we shall find this indirect assonance, which,
springing from a general feeling of unity, is, in fact, a more dainty
framework for the piece than any unity that could be impressed
on it from outside.</p>

<p>So also is it with the construction of the pieces. We find
everywhere traces of the later sonata-style; and not less in the
dance-forms than in free movements. It was too natural to
repeat the beginning of the piece at the end, then to transpose
a second theme into the main key, and in the centre to work out
the main motive in a kind of free fantasia. But so long as the
author held fast to the binary form of the piece, and to the Da
capo of each half, as was the case at this time, so long did the parts
of the “developments” and repetitions fail to concentrate themselves
so completely as not to leave a rich field of varied forms
in which fancy could move at ease. Bach’s imagination was keen
enough to give to every one of these forms, as they developed
themselves each moment, a natural and elemental strength. A
toccata by him, although they are all very various in form, or a
fantasia, like the C minor, which is of sonata-character, is built
up so firmly and self-evidently that the later uniformity of the
sonata seems rather to betray a weakening than a strengthening
of style.</p>

<p>[That the severe forms of Prelude and Fugue are abundantly
capable of expressing poetical ideas is easily shown. Turn only
to the D minor Prelude and Fugue in the second part of the
Wohltemperiertes Klavier. Although the casual reader perceives
in the one movement merely an exercise in two parts, in the
other, one in three parts, it requires only a slight exercise of
imagination to see that the work really pictures some such feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
as the following: In the Prelude, a man suddenly realises himself
in the true “out-of-doors” of this life, with the rain and hail of
difficulties and troubles sensibly battering him. Bravely, but
ineffectually, he tries to push through the tempest, and sinks
wearily into half-sleep, is awakened by a renewed riot of the
elements around, tries harder than before, and longer too, to
impress himself on his circumstances, and be master of things, and
succeeds in a sorrowful kind of way, for the storm passes, sighs
itself out, and he at last can rest. In the Fugue, he tries to begin
his work in the world. His efforts are strong in their intention,
but die down as weakly as the devil himself could wish, one after
another. But though these messengers of his will return to him
empty again and again, he still goes on. “It is the best I can do,
and something may come of it in the end,” he seems to say.
And there is in the final bars, where the subject occurs for the
last time, a certain expression of savage pleasure at the thought
of not having given in, mingled with the abiding knowledge of
an abundant measure of continual failure, such as is no imagination
to any man who cares about his work, and has arrived at the
sorrowful conviction that most of his walking must be done in
the dark.]<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the Bach Preludes show this freedom on the most
liberal scale. For the Prelude is not so much a kind of form,
like the Toccata, but a mere Piece before a Piece; it lays down
the lines to be followed, but in itself is uncertain, unfixed in form.
The Prelude may be a Toccata or a Sonata, a Symphony or an
Invention; it can let its upper part, in arioso style, wander over
the continuo, or it may burst forth in fullest polyphony. It may
have the rhythm and regularity of beat of the dances, or may
speak with the freedom of recitative without thought of a repetition.
The abundance of possibilities which Bach found at his
disposal in the working out of themes, construction, and style,
are mirrored in the Preludes, from the real fugue to the playful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>method of the court-musicians.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Anyone who undertakes the
pleasant task of simply running through the Preludes of the
“Wohltemperiertes Klavier” (<abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>), will be able to appreciate
the full spring-like freshness in which the free music of this time,
so rich in promise for the future, lived out its life. And, like the
discriminating observer of nature, he will admire, in just these
yet unspoilt forms, the great harmony and natural unity which
is exhibited by the young life of the creation. The Prelude in
E major will always seem to me a blossom of this spring-time
(<abbr title="Wohltemperiertes Klavier one">“Wohlt. Kl.” i.</abbr>)—one of the daintiest pieces ever written for
the clavier. In an easy 12/8 time the poem begins with an
allegretto theme, ingeniously invented, and playful in style. It
is supported by two voices; but they soon take part canonically
in the delightful movement. We have, in the play of cheerful
thought, come to the dominant of the dominant<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> (F sharp), and
from this F sharp we rest, in a humorous change, a moment on D,
and even G, till, just as rapidly, we emerge through a chromatic
maze at B natural once more (Bar 8). The repose of the succeeding
dominant passage is gently stirred by ravishing transient
modulations, on which the very spirit of happiness seems to rest.
A beautiful chain of syncopations leads us through F sharp minor,
and a jubilant run of semiquavers, built on a dominant chord on
E, brings us to the recapitulation of the opening subject in the key
of A (Bar 15), starting from which the movement repeats itself
accurately (for eight bars) in its eternal cheerfulness, the piece
closing with a couple of bars in Schumann’s ingenious manner,
still sweetly suggesting the spring-song of its earlier strains.</p>

<p>We find, then, that nothing essentially new in “form” has
been used by later artists, of which the germ did not already exist
in Bach. Nay, even in programme-music (supposed by many to
be an invention of modern times) for the clavier, which Kuhnau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>so quaintly worked out in his Biblical Stories,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Bach has
entered the field in a youthful composition. He is singing
the departure of his brother. The first adagio movement
in anapæstic rhythms represents the flattery of the friends,
who are trying to dissuade the traveller from his journey.
It is time for the fugue, and this is the picture of various misfortunes
which may befall him in foreign parts. A mournful
arioso passage on a ground bass,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> chromatic in character, is a
universal lament of his friends. In a full-chorded Intermezzo
they come and bid him good-bye, seeing that it cannot be
otherwise. Now the postillion sings his air, broken with octave
passages, representing the smacks of his whip; and since a fugue
is the end of all good things, we hear one in four parts raise itself
above the post-horn, with whip episodes to increase the realism.
The young Bach did not go as far as Frohberger, who represented
the assaults of robbers, crossings of the Rhine, and even forcible
ejectments with violence, on the clavier; or as Kuhnau, who
had given the cheating of Laban in “deceptive” cadences,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and
Hezekiah’s doubtings in the rehearsal of a choral; yet this kind
of programme-music declined in the eighteenth century precisely
as it has grown up again in the nineteenth.</p>

<p>If we believe Spitta, Bach also left behind him one of those
anagram-pieces which were so in the taste of his time—the fugue
on the letters B A C H. But the composition seems too leathern
and insipid for us to be able to express a decided opinion. There
is in literary criticism a well-known false method—the wish utterly
to deny insipidity to the great. But since Bach’s authorship of the
“B A C H” fugue is not vouched for, and since he never elsewhere
put together so many dull pages, we are not compelled to
load his memory with its weight.</p>

<p>As we find in Bach the possibilities of all the great forms of
the succeeding centuries, so we find in him also all the germs of
future expression, rhythm, harmony, and melody. Nothing is
more perverse than to regard this music as academic and expressionless.
Expression is never absent from counterpoint except
when it sacrifices impressionism to the mere display of technical
mastery. We shall even to-day seek in vain for piano compositions
more full of expression than some of the preludes contained
in the Wohltemperiertes Klavier. In the remarkably decadent C
sharp minor, in the B minor, so full of gentle mournfulness, in the
E flat minor with its grandiose solemnity, in the B flat minor with
its organ-like seriousness, or in the F major with its Meister-singer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
melody<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> (in Part <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Wohlt. Kl.), there is an unsurpassed depth of
expression. Nowhere is there a greater variety of characters than
would be presented by a comparison of the fugal themes in this
work. Merely to turn over a few of its pages is to see before us
an abundance of content which no other music-book would easily
conceal in so narrow a space. It is in the service of expression
that the motives for the architecture of the fugues are unfolded;
in the service of expression the rhythms are developed, whose skilful
planning is only clearly seen in a piece like the G major Prelude
(Wohlt. Kl. i.); in the service of expression are formed the
harmonies, from their simple successions, as in the C major Prelude
(W. Kl. i.) or of the C sharp major Prelude (W. Kl. ii.) to the
complicated retardations and tied notes of the B flat minor Prelude
(Wohl. Kl. i.), or in the B minor fugue (W. Kl. i.) on a theme
so wonderfully sad that no bolder chords can be found in the days
of the most furious chords of the seventh. In Bach, says Marpurg,
the different talents of a hundred other musicians were united.</p>

<p>Bach played very quietly. In his time technique began to
change its principles. The hand was no longer to be held out flat,
but curved, so as to provide a series of hammers rather than levers.
The passing of the fingers over each other, as practised by Mattheson,
a player of distinction almost equal to Bach and Handel,
gave way to a systematic <em>under</em>-passing; and the thumb, which
Bach had seen applied by former generations only to wide
stretches, began its important part as the “linking” finger. The
remains of Bach’s finger-exercises, and the directions which stand
in the lesson-book of his son Philip Emanuel, have been usefully
compared<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> by Spitta, who has drawn a picture of the technique of
John Sebastian, which in its grandeur well fits with his work. “It
was a system of under-moving fingers, worked out by unparalleled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>practice and talent, applying not merely to the thumb but to the
middle fingers, and usually so arranged that only a longer finger
can pass over a shorter.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This produced a technique which, like
Bach’s work, united past and future in one classic method. Our
thumb-technique, which in essentials goes back to Philip Emanuel,
is a mere fragment of Bach’s method, just as the whole succeeding
art was, compared with Bach, but a fragment on a large scale.”
But it is hard to be clear on these matters. Before the time of
“schools” technique was a matter of personality; and reconstruction
to us of a later age is utterly out of the question.</p>

<p>Should a diligent scholar try to reconstruct from Bach’s
pieces his technique, so far as it had influenced musical form,
he would soon be brought to a pause. For when we examine this
literature, we see that to the master everything was possible, and
that he never gave form to a conception for the sake of technique.
He is a stupendous genius who does not write for everybody, and
therefore his compositions are often difficult; but the difficulties
are never against the genius of the clavier, and can be conquered
by anything but idleness. He has, again, written some taking
show-pieces, like the Prelude and Fugues in A minor (Steingräber,
vii. 29), which, as “paying” salon pieces, sound much harder than
they are; and, alongside of these again, are pieces which spring
from the very joy in the abundance of possible techniques and
of new conceptions. To this class belongs, if genuine, the
Fantasia in A minor (Steingräber, vii. 8), in which pure technical
fireworks are let off, of short scale passages for both hands,
swinging chords and octaves, running motives with astonishing
passage effects, passages of sixths with over and under accompaniments,
and melodious phrases with embellishing harmonies.
But here the first rank is taken by the famous “Goldberg”
variations, already printed by Bach, partly set for two manuals,
an album of thirty technical conceptions, in which everything
possible in tone-material is contained, from arioso to canon, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span><i lang="it">grave</i> to <i lang="it">presto</i>; everything, in fact, which Bach ever adopted for the
setting of his ideas. The twenty-ninth variation, which can also be
played on one manual, brings before us chords and passages of interwoven
beauty which prepare beforehand the way for Liszt. Even in
technique, then, the genius of Bach stretches over centuries.</p>

<p>It cannot be exactly maintained that Bach treated the clavier
wholly individually, but he nevertheless has helped to individualise
it. At the beginning of last century, when the clavier was still for
the most part an accompanying instrument, when it sustained in
the orchestra the foundation-harmonies, even if at the same time
another clavier entered in concerto-wise, genius itself could not
release the instrument from this corporate conception without
running against the whole spirit of the time. It is remarkable
how Bach left it the character of a thorough-bass instrument,
and yet allowed it so much independence. It has at one time
the divided nature of the unifying organ, as organ-pieces were
then regarded still as practically ready for the clavier; at another
the pizzicato and running character of the lute. Bach could entitle
his formally interesting E flat major piece, Prelude, Fugue, and
Allegro (Steingräber, vii. 30) as Prélude pour le luth <em>ò çembal</em>.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
From the traditions of the lute and organ the peculiar nature
of the clavier comes into existence, and it was in the maintenance
of the <i lang="la">via media</i> between these less delicately expressive
extremes that its future lay. How <em>individually</em> Bach regarded
the clavier is seen in the pieces in which it is combined with
flute and viol da gamba or violin, or in the concertos with one,
two, three, or even four claviers. Among these the C major and
D minor concertos with three claviers, now combined, now isolated,
represent the highest points of this older form of the concerto, as
yet not adapted for solo-virtuosity. But yet plainer is his insight
in the direct transcriptions which he has made of violin pieces for
the clavier. He interpolates in the freest fashion middle voices,
which are kept together by “pedals;” ornamentations which draw
out the air of the melody in clavier-style; or rapid vibrating over-parts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>which make up for the loss of the long-drawn violin tones.
And by this insight into the peculiar character of the clavier, he
makes it more capable not only of speaking with its own voice,
but also of spreading over wider circles the literature of other
instruments by means of suitable and self-intelligible transcriptions.
Bach’s extreme love of this instrument, which so often
gave him the means of expression for his musical conceptions,
contributed not the least to such an interpretative mission.
Slowly the world accustomed itself to understand music, not
<i lang="la">per chorum</i>, but <i lang="la">per instrumentum</i>.</p>

<p>It is at this point that the great need is felt. A mechanical
advance is required to bring the expressive capacity of the clavier
into a line with the demands of genius upon it. The rivalry
between the clavicymbal and the clavichord<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> was not yet quite
decided. In Romance lands the former was the favourite; in
Germany the latter. On the former great effects could be better
produced; on the latter the more soulful tone, and the unique
embellishment called “Bebung.” Bach wrote much, including the
Wohltemperiertes Klavier, for the clavichord, which even his son
Philip Emanuel still preferred to the clavicymbal. But he was so
unable to disguise from himself the counter advantages of the
fuller and broader quill-instrument, that he published pieces for
“Kiel-flügel”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, with two manuals and registers for forte and piano.
These registers were the only means for giving light and shade to
the monotonous note of the “cymbal”; to give light and shade by
turns, as in the organ, so that on the upper manual a melody could
be played loud, and on the lower the accompaniment could be
played soft. In Kuhnau we see the forte and piano, which he
aimed at by simply striking on the clavichord, used as a means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>expression. In the Biblical Stories Jacob has just been cheated
by Laban, in receiving Leah for Rachel. “The bridegroom is
contented,” as a minuet shows us; but “his heart prophesies
misfortune,” and the measure rushes on, becomes piano and più-piano;
suddenly Jacob takes heart again—forte; after a bar or
two he goes to sleep—piano; he wakes—forte; falls into deep
slumber—piano. In his “Italian Concerto” Bach had made a
much more specialised use of this by the register. He had mingled
loud and soft parts, and each hand alternately is marked forte or
piano. In these, and similarly in the echo-movement of the suite
with “Ouverture à la manière française,” we are led to think of a
splendid clavicymbal, such as the one preserved ostensibly as
Bach’s in the Berlin Museum of Instruments. In that, every one
of the combinations of four strings can be altered by pulling a
register: the manuals admit of coupling, and a soft lute-stop is
provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
We know of a hundred attempts to improve the sound of the
clavier, and make it more expressive. Here, too, the eighteenth
century is the experimental preparation for the happy successes of
the nineteenth. Now the string-choruses were tuned in octaves,
now pedals were added for low notes, now the sound-boards were
strengthened, now the lower strings were made of copper, and the
higher of steel; and throughout a rich experience was acquired
as to the best way of constructing the separate parts. Leather
plectrums appear everywhere in order to make the tone softer
and less metallic. The clavier, in fact, was made to imitate all
possible orchestral instruments, and even such natural phenomena
as thunder and lightning, by means of register-stops. Or, the forte
and piano stops were combined, ever more artistically, into as
many as two hundred and fifty permutations, so that an endless
number of shades was possible.</p>

<p>The solution of the problem was the modern hammer-clavier
or pianoforte, in which the strings are no longer plucked but
struck with hammers, so that every <i lang="fr">nuance</i> of touch depends on
the fingers. The story of the pianoforte is the usual Story of
Inventions. While people were labouring to solve the problem
by theoretical calculation, it had long lain solved in an unsuspected
fashion before them, and those who were slowly working at the
practical realisation were personally forgotten, until a positively
sufficient experience made the new invention popular. The beginnings
of the pianoforte are therefore, as usual, obscure. The
striking of the strings with hammers had long been the method
employed in the dulcimer. At the beginning of the last century
an artist named Pantaleon Hebenstreit was much talked of, who
played the dulcimer so perfectly, that everyone was astounded
at the new sound-effects. It is possible that his success gave
the impulse: in any case, in the year 1711 there emerges in
Italy an instrument called the pianoforte—because it could be
played piano as well as forte—elaborated by a certain Bartolommeo
Cristofori, who was soon forgotten. This instrument is clearly
pictured in writings recently recovered as a hammer-clavier;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Cristofori, as curator to Ferdinand de’ Medici, had a splendid collection
of Belgian, French, and Italian Flügel-instruments to look
after, the study of which, without doubt, aided him in his invention.
His pianoforte, which at first shows a still more primitive technique,
gradually draws sensibly nearer to the modern system; yet, on
account of its unaccustomed tone and touch, it was unable to gain
any appreciable results in the following decades. Cristofori could
not have dreamt that an Italian society of our time would build a
monument to him as inventor of the world-charming pianoforte, in
the national sanctuary, the Santa Croce of Florence.</p>

<p>Whether Hebenstreit built on Cristofori, Cristofori on the
French, or the French on the Germans, is unknown. Possibly
the pianoforte was invented thrice over, in Italy, France, and
Germany. In France appears Marius in the year 1716 as the
inventor; in Germany it would seem that a certain Schröter,
incited by the success of Hebenstreit, invented it in 1717; at
least he himself says so in a writing first published in Freiberg
in 1763, ten years after the death of the instrument-maker,
Silbermann. But Silbermann had in any case the merit of
having, at a more fortunate time than Cristofori, worked so hard
at the perfecting of the pianoforte, that from him its increasing
spread and the gradual displacement of the clavicymbal and
clavichord may be dated. Yet this very Gottlieb Silbermann
had constructed a “cimbal d’amour,” which by a cleverly devised
mechanism heightened the tone of the clavichord—so “lonesome,
melancholy, and inexpressibly sweet.” But his later renown rests
on his exquisitely manipulated pianoforte. He had a good master
in this difficult work—John Sebastian Bach. When he brought
his first model to Bach the latter found it too weak in the treble
and too hard to play. Silbermann was first vexed, then stimulated
by this censure. He then sold no more, and went on making
improvements in it until the old Bach, as Agricola<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> says, gave
him unmixed commendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
If we play Bach to-day on our extremely refined pianofortes,
we are inclined to imagine that his fine effects are solely due to
the perfection of the instrument. And this opinion is not wholly
false. Though in the cembalo there sounded in his ear something
of the accustomed solemnity of the organ, there is yet in his music
a cry for a subtle and expressive instrument which he as little
possessed as Beethoven possessed an orchestra suited to his ideas.
In every great tone-creator lives a superabundance of imaginative
form which the instruments of the time cannot embody, and to which
the instruments instantly strive to become equal. Because Berlioz
was, the modern orchestra is. Because Bach was, the pianoforte is,
which knows how to express with justice the subtleties of his soul-music.
I think for example of the never-to-be-forgotten theme of the
C sharp minor prelude in the first volume of the Wohltemperiertes
Klavier. The clavichord could only give this theme in a thin
lament; the spinet in a rigid and unmanageable form. But what
features does not the motive show as the piece runs on! Now it has
the slow-breathing rhythm of a noble aspiration, now the opening
eyes of an expectant Cecilia, now the heavy oppression of a martyr
soul, now the holy rage of a last noble complaint, now the sweet
weariness of Christian humility. And with these various tints the
piece builds itself up into a broad picture, which leads from renunciations
through pain to renunciations; with these tints every line,
every note of the theme is given an active life, as it pursues its
course. Composition like this demanded an instrument which
should be capable of a new expression in every touch. All that
Bach dreamed of, the pianoforte gave, awakening the gentle soul
of the clavichord to an unthought-of fulness of existence, and
changing the mechanical force of the clavicymbal to a sudden
consciousness of personality. The voices of a fugue-passage would
now be personally separated from each other; every line in the
great lacework could be brought out at the moment according
to the feelings of the performer. What, under the sacred laws
of Bach’s music, slumbered in the depth of the breast, found in
the new instrument its unreserved interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>It seems at first sight almost tragic that Bach himself can
never have realised these effects, which are so familiar to us in
connection with his music as it is nowadays interpreted on the
pianoforte. But perhaps it is the wisdom of Fate to ordain that
the cup of the artist should ever be dashed by a certain bitterness,
the conscious falling short of attainment as it appears in complete
idea before his mind.</p>

<p>When an artistic form reaches perfection, its active life is
over, and it is a subject of contemplation, no longer a tool to
be used.</p>

<p>And just so, when the instrument necessary to the full interpretation
of Bach’s clavier-music, the pianoforte, had arrived
within measurable distance of perfection, then did Bach’s own
Art reach its highest formal expression, then once more did the
fashion of things suffer a change, and his work began to take<span class="pagenum" id="1Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
its place as a colossal monument pointing on the road towards
the House Beautiful.</p>

<p>Bach is, as it were, the priest of modern music. His congregation
sit at his feet daily. Wherever a pianoforte is found,
there is his temple. But though the priest cannot utterly control
the worship of his hearers (nay, many will bow the knee to
Rimmon in the house of the God), still his voice is strong, his
words are true, and they may hear if they will.] This is the
significance of Bach, and the longer we live, the more we shall
believe it.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> The word “Intavolata” was used about 1600 to describe the “arrangement” of a
many-voiced madrigal for the keyed instrument. Hence “intavolatura” comes to mean
a “copy” presenting all the parts at one view, and such “arrangements” for clavier
were common and popular.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> More than a century before Kuhnau, an English clavier composer, John Munday,
composed a piece of “programme-music,” with the various sections labelled, <i>e.g.</i>—Faire
Wether, Lightening, Thunder, Calme Wether, A Cleare Day. It is the third piece in the
Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> Bach died in 1750. Hawkins published his great History of Music in 1776, and
in spite of the fact that he had his information direct from Bach’s son, John Christian
Bach, then living in London, he appears quite ignorant of any of his works but the
Clavierübung (1731-42), from which he prints three short harpsichord pieces.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="label">[76]</a> This is certainly not so, historically speaking. The strict canon is far older than
what we understand by “imitation.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">[77]</a> Long before Bach was born, we find an English composer anticipating this
comprehensive treatment of the scales. Before 1667, John Jenkins wrote a series of
“Fancies” on each degree of the alphabetical scale, three movements to the set.
The keys actually used are C, D, E, F, G, A, B flat, all minor except F and B flat.
But, as is mentioned in a previous note, in one of the three movements in F, Jenkins
modulates nearly through all the flat keys, at any rate as far as D flat, thus showing that
already in the middle of the seventeenth century an Englishman contemplated Bach’s
accomplished work of using the scale on every semitone. And this by no means fixes
the ultimate limit. Bull’s fantasia on Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La—piece number 51 in the
Fitzwilliam book—modulates into all the twelve keys. Though this does not <em>prove</em> that
instruments were as yet tuned with an equal temperament, it does prove that Bach was
in no sense the originator of the idea, and the probability is very great that the system
was in practical use in England in Elizabethan times. Bull was flourishing in 1590.</p>

<h3>The “Galant” School</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Bach died, the musical centre of gravity tended to
Germany; but it was doubtful what precise line would be
followed. On Bach anything could be built. A great period
of counterpoint might rise in which voices might go through
a new series of harmonic complexities, similar to, and yet so
different from those of the Middle Ages. Or there might come
a period of great suites in which the simple dance-forms might
grow in many-sided development. A high pathetic style might
be introduced, or the details of expression might attract the
attention of the amateur. The forms of the various compositions
might alter in either direction, of new freedom or new restraint.
Counterpoint might be deserted, concerted playing might be
improved in the direction of increased grace.</p>

<p>For all or any of these possibilities Bach laid a foundation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and it only remained for the taste of the time to decide on
the choice that should be made.</p>

<p>The taste of the time, leaving on one side both the pathetic
and the scholarly, went off into the domain of the graceful.
The experience of music was similar to that of architecture,
which had already gone through the epoch of the “baroque”
and “rococo,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> by which designers had sought to give variety
to the lines of their work. Compared with the energy and
manly swing of the Italian Concerto, a sonata of Philip Emanuel
Bach is fairly characterised as “rococo.” In place of the sober
delight in bold outline appears the “galant” appreciation of
eccentricities and wayward curvings. Passion is ashamed of
confessing itself openly, and offers the amusing spectacle of a
natural emotion wilfully covering itself with an incongruous
vesture of conventional form.</p>

<p>The newly formed tendency towards simple sensuousness
does not obtrude itself; it merely smiles in the graceful oscillations
of subtle harmonies.</p>

<p>Caprice is the true ruler, and in improvised outpourings,
speaking pauses, piquant leaps, stupefying enharmonic changes,
purposed perverseness of motive, she places the same material
under the hands of the fair performers, which, a short time
before, had taken such a scholarly form.</p>

<p>Where strict canons of the voices used to be carried honestly
through, we now observe a pleasant trifling with imitation which
becomes coquettish, and the pedantic old Dux and Comes<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> put
up very well with the change in their conditions of service.
Counterpoint turns into mere accompaniment, and daintiness
with humorous ornament is the object of the composer.</p>

<p>The new auditor is the delicate dilettante who listens no
longer so much to the inner parts, the ancient severity of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>vanishes and is replaced by chord music. Now we listen to
the melody, to the over-part, and we unfold its whole charm,
revealing a hundred secrets of melodic pleasure, and disentangling
them at ease. And in all this capricious enlivening of music
there remains the same delightful contradiction as in the paintings
and buildings of the time—the contradiction between inner
freedom and the aim at a fixed form. The external form is to
replace what was offered by the inner; and yet, from these new
free figures, the intention is primarily to gain this form. The aim
is not at collections of suites, but at the type of the free movement,
of the piece, of the sonata. It is the same spectacle as when we
see Hogarth and Greuze expressing a definite moral lesson in their
pictures, or architectural principles conveyed in the play of childhood.
In music, however, that exclusive predominance of form,
which the French Revolution caused to prevail in the representative
art, has never been quite attained. It is important to notice
that this was only possible since music had emancipated itself
from French influence. It was only in Germany that a Beethoven
could arise.</p>

<p>The distinction between “professional” and “amateur” is
one to which our attention is always more and more drawn.
“Tablatures” and apparatus for the scholar vanish gradually,
and titles meant to attract the amateur become more frequent.
Bach’s inscription—“for the delight of amateurs”—over suites
and concertos, appears on more than one title-page. We read
“Cecilia playing on the clavier and satisfying the hearing,” or
“Manipulus musices, a Handful of Pastime at the Clavier,” or
again, “the Busy Muse Clio,” or even “Clavier-practice for the
delight of mind and ear, in six easy <em>galanterie parties</em> adapted
to modern taste, composed chiefly for young ladies.” A certain
Tischer has put it very shortly on some suites—“The Contented
Ear and the Quickened Soul.” As the most complete refiner
of this taste, relying on the public at large, appears Philip
Emanuel Bach, who inscribes his sonatas “easy” or “for ladies,”
and thus openly confessed, much as he was censured therefor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
by the pedants, that he had systematically introduced the light
<i lang="fr">genre</i> as a music for the future.</p>

<p>Like the princes in the seventeenth century, or the middle
classes in the nineteenth, it was the nobles in the eighteenth
who played the part of Maecenas; and under their patronage
appears, for the first time, a precisely marked musical society.
Here too, in music, the nobility became an invaluable link
between the artistic court and that public interest in art which,
it would seem, is the necessary condition of all future advance.
Even in the didactic musical romance which old Kuhnau wrote
in 1700 under the title of “The Musical Quack,” we miss the
type of the amateur Maecenas. In the background, invisible,
stands the prince who keeps the chapel; in the foreground there
are only musicians and quacks. The amateur who is not a quack,
the genuine dilettante, first attains importance in the beginning
of the century; but very shortly the concerts which are given
in the salons of the Fürnbergs, Esterhazys, and Schwarzenbergs,
do more for the beneficial advancement of art than even the
devotion of a keenly musical court such as that of Frederick
the Great at first was. The greater courts, like Dresden and
Munich, begin somewhat to decline, while the smaller advance,
and in England, Italy, and elsewhere, the nobility, who are
not unlike small sovereign princes, aid the spread and development
of music. The nobility are soon followed by the gentry;
but it was not till the Revolution had shattered the nobles that the
bourgeois Maecenas steps upon the scene. In this displacement
of old relations it was inevitable that the clavier should play its
important part; in accordance with its social nature it advanced
more and more from an accompanying or supplementary instrument
into an independent centre of drawing-room existence, as
well as of bourgeois evening parties. Thus, in the attractive and
successful pieces of the generation from 1750 to 1800, its popularity
was for the first time established. Old Bach had as yet been the
most serious professional musician who had yielded to “galant”
impulses; and his concessions to the popular taste were only by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
the way. The distinction between
public improvisation on
set themes, and public interpretation
of written works, was
not yet sharply defined. The
player was at his highest when
he extemporised variations or
fugues on a given subject. Such
had been the improvisations of
Sebastian Bach; but the spirit
of improvisation, as it lives in
the works of Philip Emanuel,
is something quite different. In
him the hand directly follows
the inner feeling, constructs
easily and simply, and plays for
the sake of the playing, not for the sake of the art. Before the clavier
had become a social instrument, this division of labour between
composers and players had become imperative; reproduction was
bound to diverge into a separate branch. The amateur, on whom
more and more the art depends, is incapable of composing, but
he will, on his clavier, hear the works of the masters, which are
now so numerous, or even play them himself. He desires to
have acts of operas, arrangements of concertos, or many dainty
short pieces. The old clavier-books, which we can trace from
the Elizabethan Virginal Book to the volumes of Bach’s children,
now gradually disappear. Instead of copying with its personal
character, the press is more and more in requisition, and the
musical treasury is more and more thrown open to the public.
The engraving of notes, during the eighteenth century, rapidly
improves, and the clefs and types become more simple. The
ornamental devices become constantly more fixed, and the player
has less and less liberty in his use of them. And whereas, in
earlier times, the instruction-books did not always distinguish
between composition and playing, now, since Couperin’s time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
the instruction-book of pure playing became constantly more
common; while Philip Emanuel, to whom, perhaps with justice,
we trace the systematisation of the principles of modern clavier-playing,
wrote a book on playing, and then waited eight years
before publishing a second part on the thorough bass.</p>

<p>The extension of musical interest led further to such a
multitude of musical magazines as even to-day is not to be found.
For the most part they disappear after a few years, but we have,
as a matter of fact, in a year’s issue of such a paper, a very fair
picture of musical tendencies. I have before me a volume of the
last of these, published in 1762, by George Ludewig Winter, in
Berlin. It is well printed, with dainty rococo borders. Very
amusing and characteristic is the sanguine Preface, in which also
is to be discerned the inability of the German tongue to restrain
itself while talking of our classics. “Music,” says the publisher,
“serves either to delight with its mere art the professor, whether
he be such by nature or by cultivation—as a well-built house,
or a well-laid out garden, satisfies the connoisseur; or, on the
other hand, it is the language of emotion. Then roar forth tones
teeming with revenge, sorrow glides over the strings, passion
frantically beats the air, joy revels in the blue æther, friendship
and love sigh forth on the delicate notes, praise and thankfulness
well from a full heart on the vigorous melody, or rise, cleaving the
clouds on the tongues of men, to the very throne of the Almighty.”</p>

<p>The good man, with his fearful fluency, declares that he is
going to bring forward much of the lighter kind—meaning what
we call the dilettante class of music. The numbers appeared
week by week, and the continuation was always postponed for
the next, often at the most thrilling passages—in the approved
style of the clever magazine. The authors’ names are only given
when they are very well known. Among these distinguished men
are many whose names have not remained in the memory of
history—fashionable composers, such as every epoch has in plenty.
But there are also Philip Emanuel Bach, Kirnberger, and many
others of the great Bach School. Most of it is clavier-music.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Operatic airs, which occasionally appear, are so arranged that
the voice part, under which the words are printed, is played by
the right hand, and the completing orchestral notes are written
small in the upper staves. There are also popular songs in
abundance. A French spirit breathes through these pages; a
fashionable spirit of enjoyment. The short character-pieces,
which the French loved so dearly to introduce with significant
titles, are mingled plentifully with sonatas and rondos, arranged
in the Italian manner. Under the character-pieces, in the appropriate
places, as in the biblical stories of Kuhnau, the explanatory
programme-text is printed. Thus in a piece called
“La Spinoza,”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the developments are marked as being philosophic
reflections on a certain theme. Two pieces, called “Wonderment”
and “Youthful Joy,” easily explain themselves. In
one piece entitled, “Two friends grumbling over their wine,” by
the arrangement and form of the two voices, in right and left
hands, is represented how they converse, console each other,
gain courage, and wait for a friendly glance of fortune. The
most humorous is a short clavier-piece, “A Compliment,” which,
usually in two voices, exhibits the following spirited contents:
“If you are well, I am charmed.” “Rather I am glad that
I see you so well” (Repeated). “I have heard that you have
been poorly: I am sorry to hear it.” “Heaven be praised I
am recovered.” “But I am ashamed”—“allow me”——They
quarrel who shall bring the chair, and finally sit down. “I
recommend myself”—“and <em>I</em> recommend <em>myself</em>”—“to your
friendship.”</p>

<p>It was precisely at this period, when the clavier first became
truly popular, that its construction was rapidly and constantly
improved. It was then that the separation of the two systems
of mechanism—the so-called English, and the Viennese—took
place. The names mean nothing, for both systems alike arose
in Germany proper. The distinction lies in the fact that in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>the English the hammer rests on a separate bracket from which
the key strikes it, while in the Viennese the hammer rests directly,
though loose, on the end of the key-lever.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Although Germany was so partial to the clavichord with
its intimate intellectuality—a quality which even to-day we can
only reproduce in its fulness by reproducing the clavichord—yet
it was the German pianoforte which for a long time took
the lead. It was one of the first triumphs of German manufacture,
and perhaps precisely because so little manufacture lay
in it. In Italy the invention of Cristofori had vanished without
leaving a trace. So utterly indeed was it forgotten, that when
Italy decided, though very tardily, to replace the Gravicembalo
by the pianoforte, instruments of this construction were preferably
brought out there with the notice, “built in the Prussian
manner.” Alongside of the Silbermann pianofortes, those of
Friederici of Gera—which were known as “Fort Bien” and were
still built largely on the clavichord model—and those of Spath
of Regensburg, enjoyed a great renown in the second half of
the century. But soon, chiefly through emigration, the best
manufactories were transported to foreign parts, and it is only
in the latest advance of German industry, especially by the
labours of Bechstein and Blüthner, that pianos built in Germany
itself have again achieved a world-wide repute.</p>

<p>The great French, English, American, and Austrian piano-factories
can almost all be traced back to Germans. The three great
Parisian houses, those of Erard, Pleyel, and Pape, were founded
by Germans. Steinway emigrated from Brunswick to build in
America those pianos which are to-day regarded as the best.
Johann Zumpe carried the hammer-clavier to England,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> where
it was played by German executants, and brought into repute.
It was, however, English houses, with that of Broadwood at their
head, that effected the improvements which have resulted in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>appropriation of the name “English” to the mechanism of
Silbermann.</p>

<p>Factories alone, however, would never have brought about the
final victory of the piano if there had been no virtuosos to play
them. Clementi in England, Mozart in Germany and Austria,
were the workers who won the decisive triumph of the piano.
Even Philip Emanuel Bach had much preferred the clavichord
to the newer instrument. But Mozart, the first world-virtuoso,
the idol of the concert hall, thinking solely of sound-effects in
the great halls, never hesitated for a moment between clavicymbal
and piano. In 1777, at the age of twenty-one, he made, at
Augsburg, the acquaintance of Silbermann’s disciple, Stein, the
inventor of the Viennese mechanism. This received the name
of “Viennese” when Stein’s children came to Vienna, and there,
along with Streicher, the well-known friend of Schiller, established
the world-renowned business. Here in this family for the first
time appears a new phenomenon in musical society. Round the
king of clavier-builders and his musical wife, young Streicher and
Nanette Stein, there moves a brisk circle of musical spirits. It
is a type which in our time has further gained in importance.
With the greater popularity of the art, the social standing of
the piano manufacturer has risen; and nothing contributed more
to the introduction of the piano into middle-class houses than the
reputation of this much-envied Viennese coterie.</p>

<p>Old Stein and young Streicher are two clearly-marked types.
The latter is a romantic spirit, raves over the just-played
“Robbers” of his school-fellow Schiller, forms the plan of going
to Hamburg to perfect himself in clavier-playing under Philip
Emanuel Bach, but never gets there, since he spends all his
time running from town to town with the restless Schiller. Then
he gives music lessons; next he meets Nanette Stein, marries
her, goes to Vienna, becomes manager of the factory, and makes
the invention associated with his name, in which the hammers
strike from above. Finally, he becomes a centre of Viennese
musical life. What a contrast is this modern industrial prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to the old Stein, working like a mediæval crafts-master there in
Augsburg at his claviers, and giving equal devotion to every
single part! He has been sketched by Mozart in a well-known
letter; and I reprint this picture of the last of the old patriarchal
clavier-builders, because it is not less interesting as showing the
type than as showing the condition of technique at that time.</p>

<p>“I must now,” writes Mozart, “begin at once with Stein’s
pianoforte. Before I saw anything of Stein’s work I liked Spath’s
best; but now I must give the preference to Stein’s, for they damp
much better than the Regensburg instruments. If I strike hard,
whether I let the fingers lie on the keys or lift them up, the sound
is over and done with the very instant I lift my hand. I may come
down on the keys as I like, the tone will always be the same;
it never hangs fire; it doesn’t get weaker, or grow stronger, or stay
on; it’s just all <em>one</em>. It’s true you can’t get a pianoforte like that
under three hundred florins, but the trouble and diligence he shows
is not to be repaid. His instruments have this point that makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
them better than others: they are made with an escapement which
there isn’t a man in a thousand knows anything of; and without
this it is just impossible for a pianoforte to help blocking or
sounding again. His hammers, when the piano is played, fall
back again the very moment they touch the strings, whether
you hold the key down or let it go. When he has finished a
piano, so he says, he sits down to it and tests all kinds of passages,
runs and leaps, and works and scrapes until the piano’ll
do anything; for he works only for the good of music, and not
his own merely, or he would be done long before. He often says:
‘If I myself didn’t love music so passionately, or couldn’t do a
little on the piano, I should long ago have lost all patience in
my work; but I’m just a lover of instruments which don’t try
the player and will last.’ His pianos <em>do</em> last, too. He guarantees
that the sounding-board won’t warp or break. When he has got
a sounding-board ready for a piano, he puts it in the air, rain, snow,
sun, or any beastly thing, to warp it, and then he glues crossbars
in until it is strong and firm. He’s quite glad when it warps, for
you’re about certain nothing more can happen to it. He often
cuts into it himself, and glues it again, and so makes it strong.
He has three of these pianos ready, and I have played to-day on
them for the first time.</p>

<p>“The machine which you move with the knee is also made
better by him than by others. I scarcely touch it, when off it
goes; and as soon as I take my knee the least bit away, you
can’t hear the slightest after-sound.”</p>

<p>We see from this letter of Mozart’s that in 1777 the “escapement,”
which lets the hammers fall back immediately after the
strings are struck, was as yet by no means universal, but that
the pedal, which was pressed at the side by the knee and raised
the dampers, was already a usual feature. What numberless
small modifications and improvements must have been introduced
before the developed mechanism exhibited by the key-levers,
the hammers, the dampers, the escapements, the pedals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the sounding-boards, could have advanced to the self-evident
simplicity which made possible the meteoric splendours of piano-technique
about the middle of this century! Prices for pianos
were still fairly high. The younger Ruckers obtained three
thousand francs for a clavier, but it had painted on it those
rich pictures with which the spinet, when it began to take its
place among household furniture, was so captivatingly adorned.
We hear also that the Parisian pianos with leather-plectrums
(jeu de buffle) fetched, in their finest specimens, as much as
three thousand francs. A Wagner clavicymbal from Dresden,
which was a so-called <i lang="de">Deckenclavier</i>, in which the tone could be
softened or strengthened by fan-shaped dislocations of the inner
lid, fetched six hundred and sixty thalers; and Frederick the
Great actually gave seven hundred thalers to Silbermann for
the first hammer-claviers. If Stein, with his three hundred
florins, seems to fall off from this price, we must remember the
difference in the purchasing power of money. But, to-day, two
thousand marks for a good pianoforte is cheap in comparison
with the prices of those days. It is only through the growth
of popularity that the greater demand and the lower price have
become possible.</p>

<p>I turn to the works themselves. Our step falls very
heavy, and our judgment may easily be unduly harsh, when
we have just parted with old Bach. This meeting with genius,
which we celebrate in every bar—this earnest greatness which
meets us at every turn, has made us very exacting in our
demands for the higher beauty. In the first moment the
“Galant” School seems to us a school of pigmies, until the
sight has again adjusted itself, and the vision has again become
awake to the miniature beauties of this smaller art. A good
transition is provided by Handel, for, against Handel, Philip
Emanuel Bach appears an astonishing genius.</p>

<p>The tendency of the public, to group celebrities in pairs, has
brought not merely Goethe and Schiller, but Bach and Handel,
into juxtaposition. How little the scholarly hermit had in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
common with the grandiose world-musician—who first followed
the wise prescription, glory in Italy, gain in England—would be
seen from a comparison of their clavier-writings, which are a fair
average of their general work. Handel is the negation of the
classic. He gets his results from materials close at hand; brings
them into plastic clearness, and writes from the point of view of
the vulgar herd; he is never troubled by an exacting inward conception,
or overwhelmed by his own imagination, as are all true
classic artists.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Handel’s clavier-pieces are written in an extravagantly
popular style. His suites, which moreover embrace not dance-forms
only; his capriccios, variations and fantasias, flow like
futile “water-music.” They are brilliant without being difficult,
and entertaining without being suggestive. There is no colour
on the sky of their landscapes; no tempest lashes their trees.
We roll in our coaches on well-macadamised roads, the melody
of the wheels reminding us meanwhile of this or that well-worn
turn in the operas or oratorios. Seldom is a halt necessary in
order to look at the view. Perhaps we may stop a moment
longer than usual at those frequent singing sarabands in the
popular style, at the charming salon-gigues (especially the long
one in G minor), the genuine virtuoso’s Tarantella, or at the
better F sharp minor suite with its short free prelude, staccato
largo, insinuating fugue and dramatic gigue. Perhaps, also, the
fugue with its <em>three beats</em> from the E minor Prelude may please
us; but there is a something which the whole fails to give us.
It is an acquaintance—not a personal intimacy.</p>

<p>Quite other is the impression produced by the “galant”
music of Philip Emanuel Bach. While his elder brother Friedemann
stands somewhat nearer to Sebastian in kind, and actually
wrote pieces, like the C minor fugue, of which the old man need
not have been ashamed, Philip Emanuel, with greater decision and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>also with greater significance, pursued a different path. It is as if
fate had marked out this difference. Sebastian Bach held
Friedemann as the cleverer musician; but he frittered his life
away. Philip was first set to study jurisprudence, and out of the
painstaking lawyer grew the sober and energetic composer. The
life of Philip was as simple as his father’s. In 1740, at the age of
twenty-six, he went to the court of Frederick the Great, where he
worked as royal cembalist and accompanist. In 1767 he went to
Hamburg, and died there in 1788. He does not seem to have
been able to agree with the King; and it is likely enough that he
felt and worked more freely in Hamburg. Berlin was always
having trouble with its people. Had Philip Emanuel stayed there,
Berlin would have been the greatest centre of piano-playing in
Germany, and its walls would have been associated with lasting
memories of the ancestors of modern musical forms. Had Mozart,
in later years, accepted the offer of Frederick William <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of a
position as chief Kapellmeister with the extraordinary salary of
three thousand thalers, Berlin would have been enabled to absorb
a little of the musical life of Vienna. Or, later still, if the Academy
of Singing had been given to Mendelssohn (who was a candidate),
rather than to Rungenhagen, the intoxicating glory of Leipzig,
which lasted for a time, would have been transferred to the banks
of the Spree. But the spirit of Zelter remained over Berlin.</p>

<p>In 1753 Philip Emanuel published at his own expense his
“Essay on the true Method of playing the Clavier.” This was the
most copious work on clavier technique that had yet appeared.
It was at the same time the sufficient apology for the technique of
the thumb, which has become the ground-work of our fingering.
When the extreme importance of the thumb had at last been
recognised, it was not hard to investigate systematically the places
of its application. The main rules were necessarily that, in ascending,
the thumb of the right hand is put <em>after</em> one or more black
keys, and the thumb of the left hand in descending, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>.
The setting of the thumb on the black keys themselves must be
avoided, and the passing over of one finger by another, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
earlier had been the main feature in scale passages, was now
abandoned. The whole art was built on the thumb, which passed
under in the right place. This work of Philip Emanuel, which
gives special attention to the legato, may be called a panegyric
on the thumb. In this clear insight, as well as in the arrangement
of his exercises, which begin with scales and chords, preferring the
unison practice of the two hands, and advancing slowly to easy pieces,
his work is still one of our most modern exercise-books. We might
guess that in this diligent application of his thumb-technique to
scales and broken chords, Philip Emanuel places in the forefront
of his exercises certain scale figures which to-day could not correspond
to the most pressing necessities of the piano-player. We
should expect them to be a mere training of the hand, and no
preparation for the real difficulties which appear in actual literature.
A glance at the works of any great master will show us, however,
that such is not the case. These very scales, chain-passages, and
broken chords, which are the material of teaching, are also the
figures of free composition. Some fashionable composers may
have employed them extravagantly, because they were at the
fingers’ ends of the players, but the most independent writers must
use them, because they are, from the very nature of the clavier, the
most fruitful in effect and most harmonious in sound. The old
disruption of musical material into short passages of four or five
notes was now antiquated. Performers practised the whole scale
and the chord. And since Philip Emanuel carried through this
natural training with methodical clearness, his teaching has been
fruitful, and has not run merely <em>alongside</em> of the literature. In his
book we can clearly see how the clavier has contributed not least
to the formation of modern secular musical perception. In this
its equal temperament, which was so urgently necessary, and its
complete presentation of the tone-material, which so to speak we
have only to read off, have largely aided.</p>

<p>The case is dissimilar with his treatment of the “manieren.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
On their employment he writes as follows: “No man, assuredly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>hath doubted concerning the necessity of ‘manieren.’ We can
observe it herefrom, that we meet them everywhere in great
abundance. Everywhere are they indispensable, if one considers
their use. They hang the notes together, and give them life;
they give them, if it be necessary, a particular energy and weight;
they make them pleasing and therefore awaken a peculiar attention;
they assist to make clear what is their meaning, which may
be sorrowful or glad or otherwise disposed, as it pleaseth, yet do
they contribute of their own thereto; they give a notable part of
opportunity and material to the true execution; a moderate
composition can by them be aided, as without them the best
air is empty and monotonous, and the plainest meaning must
appear throughout obscure.” This is a judgment which surprises
us in a man so intelligent and advanced as Philip Emanuel. He
has not yet perceived that ornamentations were in his time only
the relics of an earlier style. An appoggiatura, which takes away
half or two-thirds of its note, and thus becomes a mere melodious
retardation, or a double-shake which completely disintegrates its
note, and requires to be expressed by an antiquated stenographic
mark, is already a mere fossil in a period which gives such
independence to the melody. It is not the notes which then
appear which are fossil, but their arrangement as decorations.
What had originally been truly decoration, in the heyday of
figuration, had, in the course of the eighteenth century, long
become an emancipated melodic phrase. The idea of the retardation,
which earlier veiled itself under the name of appoggiatura
with suspended main-note, was not allowed to step in openly;
and the doppelschlag<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> or the trill could say plainly what they
were, without masquerading as modest satellites of some main-note
or other. Had Philip Emanuel but had the courage to
discard the old signs, and to hear the customary ornamentations
as independent music, he would have been able to spare himself
much dead weight, to avoid much confusion, and to get rid of the
trammels of many dead traditions, which have come down even to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>our day. He has in his book exhibited a stirring knowledge and
an individual treatment of the “manners”; yet he was forced to
maintain an arbitrary distinction between the “manners” and
the other figurations, although between the turn and any other
melodious line-curve there is no longer any essential difference
whatever. He has not been able to introduce any system into the
relation of the appoggiatura with its note; and, because he saw
that the effect of the appoggiatura could be produced equally well
without the little note, he has been obliged to take refuge in the
sentence: “The appoggiaturas are partly written like other notes
and thrown into the bar, and partly specially indicated by small
notes; while the larger ones keep their full value to the eye,
although in practice they lose something of it.” At this point he
should have been able to see that a system of “manieren” as such
was no longer possible.</p>

<p>From indications given by Philip Emanuel, it would seem
that in these matters he was deliberately behind his time. He
bemoans that the well-known marks in clavier-pieces were already
beginning to be strange, and points to the careful way in which
the French had always put in their marks. He delights as a rule
in setting up the French as the masters of the clavier-exercise,
and is vexed that people had an “evil prejudice” against their
pieces, “which yet,” he says, “have always been a good school
for clavier-players, forasmuch as this nation, by the smoothness
and neatness of its playing, hath marked itself off specially from
others.” Philip Emanuel’s love for the French is a very important
point to keep in mind in appraising his works. Not only did
he find in them the only great precedents for his “galant” style;
he has also expressly continued the method of Couperin and
Rameau by transcriptions, in the French manner and the French
language. Nay, his endeavour, in his sonatas and rondos, to
construct stiffer forms with <i lang="fr">reprises</i>, appears as a mere continuation
of the French rondo; and, however Italian the musical form
may be, in more than one of his pieces, we inevitably think of
the “Cyclopes” of Rameau. Possibly his whole book was suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
by Couperin’s “L’Art de toucher le clavecin,” and respect
for this French tradition has hindered him from revolutionising
the “manieren,” which still had their justification in France, so
thoroughly as he did revolutionise the finger-exercise. It is thus
very amusing to see how he himself challenges comparison with
Couperin. He calls him “a teacher formerly so profound,” referring
of course to the “manieren.” The “formerly,” of course, implies
that Couperin had not yet learnt the thumb method, and had been
too fond of changing the fingers on one note. In point of ornamentation
it was <em>he</em> that was conventional; and in point of fingering—why,
old Sebastian, lately dead, stood between him and
Couperin.</p>

<p>“Fantasia-making without strict tempo,” says Philip Emanuel
in one place of the Essay, “seems in the main to be specially
adapted for the expression of the emotions, because every kind of
barring brings with it a certain constraint.” In this verdict and in
its application lies for us to-day, viewed externally, the greatest
surprise which Philip Emanuel offers us. He has, as a matter of
fact, written many fantasias which are almost designed without
bars, and thus very logically give expression to the character of
improvisation which they bear. They are great recitatives full of
reflective melodies, of linked staccati, of sounding broken chords,
which the player, when moved, knows how to unfold. They were
the last free specimens of the unfettered forms of the older time.</p>

<p>Not only in these fantasias, but as a rule in his whole
creative energy, especially in the Hamburg period, Philip Emanuel
exhibits that extempore humour and freedom, which has at all
times given to clavier-pieces their greatest charm. He has
sufficient invention to be rarely at a loss; and the pieces from his
earlier “Württemberger Sonaten,” which are still more contrapuntal
than the later, or from the later six volumes “Für Kenner
und Liebhaber,”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> have all that variety and multiplicity in unity
which was also a feature of the collections of John Sebastian. But
the desire for caprice works in him more strongly than the fulness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>of invention. He is untiring in pulling a melody humorously to
pieces, in surprises of pause or in remarkable transitions. Occasionally
his language positively dances, and it is hard to be certain
whether it is intentional distortion—a cloak for poverty—or the
genuine caprice of the moment which leads him after the charms
of eccentricity. In any case he belongs to those rare and subtle
natures which in a moment give us the genuine artistic touch of
brotherhood.</p>

<p>Even in his harmonies his freedom is clearly noticeable. He
does not object to write separate movements in different keys,
which he often connects by direct transitions. The third Sonata
in the “Kenner und Liebhaber” stands in the first movement in
B minor, in the second in G minor, and in the third in B minor
once more. The fifth Sonata, which is set in F major, begins
quietly with a phrase in C minor. In the first Rondo of volume
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> we find the chord of the seventh (G, E, B, C sharp), set at the
key-deciding place, <em>in B minor</em>; a chord at which some of our best
memories of Wagner are revived. For such things he was severely
censured by his comrades in the profession.</p>

<p>As to his melody, it is as delightful as is to be expected from
“galant” music, and from that only. At one time it shows a
charming sentimentalism, in which the stronger use of retardations
has its share, now it is frisky and playful, toying with itself; in
both cases anticipating Mozart. Specially characteristic of the
author are numerous melodic phrases, the like of which have
played an important part down to our own time. Philip Emanuel
used them with the greatest depth and penetration in the F sharp
minor movement of the A major sonata (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> in Kenner und
Liebhaber, vol. i). In all these points he manifests his independence;
and in spite of his study of the French, it is but seldom
that, as in the “Siciliana” of one of his sonatas in the “Musikalisches
Allerley,” we catch an echo of a phrase from Couperin.</p>

<p>Like all the “galants,” he wrote much. A considerable
number of his works were printed in his own time in the magazines
or separately. Among these the sonatas to Frederick the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Great to Charles Eugene of Württemberg, to Amalie of Prussia,
and the “Kenner und Liebhaber,” take the first place. But
yet more remained unprinted. Prosniz has counted four hundred
and twenty of his clavier pieces, of which two hundred and fifty
were printed. There is no modern comprehensive edition of his
works, but the “Kenner und Liebhaber” has been very beautifully
reissued by Krebs in the Berlin Academy collection of
original editions. Apart from the first volume these are written
exclusively for pianoforte.</p>

<p>The name of Philip Emanuel generally rises to our lips
when we speak of the origins of the modern forms of chamber-music
and symphony. This is correct enough if we are content
to establish his claims as an agent in the crystallisation of the
two main forms of classical composition—the Sonata and the
Rondo. But the creator of these forms he was not; he found
them very far advanced in France and Italy, and on the other
hand he handles them so freely that their regulation cannot be
said to have been completed till the days of Haydn and Mozart.
Thus he is in these points also but an intermediary.</p>

<p>The strict sonata introduces first a main subject, then in
an allied key an allied subject; next the middle section<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in
which these subjects are developed and completed; and lastly
it repeats the exposition, transposing the subordinate subject,
however, with a view to the finale, into the main key.</p>

<p>In the Rondo, on the contrary, there is <em>one</em> main theme and
many subordinate motives. The main theme is chiefly melodious;
the by-themes alternate in all kinds of forms among the repetitions
of the melodic strophe.</p>

<p>To the Sonata and the Rondo all older dance and fantasia
forms gradually gravitated. The Sonata is the more dramatic,
the Rondo the more lyrical. The Rondo, considered as to logical
content, is the more organic; but advance and climax are wanting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>to it. The Sonata on the other hand, is, because of its <i lang="fr">reprises</i>,
less intellectual than architectural; but it has the sobriety of
greatness. Usually, in thinking of the forms of this musical age,
our thoughts dwell on the Sonata—in which form as a rule the
first movement was cast. But the Rondo was equally important, and
is equally often used in the second or last movement. Purer dance-forms
were always in use as intermezzos between the movements.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>In Philip Emanuel, then, we see a preference for the types<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of the sonata and the rondo which prepares the way for their
sole supremacy. He only needed to proceed eclectically. Not
only the French Rondo but the Italian Sonata had led to the
<i lang="fr">reprise</i> form. Philip Emanuel did not advance far beyond these
models. A second theme is not universal in his works; and
only the modulation of the keys within the first half, to the
dominant or relative major, is strongly stamped on them. The
Sonata movement with him still admits of all <i lang="it">tempi</i>. In the
third of the “Kenner und Liebhaber” Sonatas the peculiar sonata-form
is not on the whole adhered to, but allegretto, andante,
cantabile, follow each other in free fashion. On the other hand,
in the following piece, the first and the last movements both
show the sonata-form; but in the first of the “Württembergers”
only the last movement has the stricter sonata-style. The third
sonata of Volume <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of the “Kenner und Liebhaber” is actually
written in a single movement. On the other hand the second
Württemberger begins with a genuine sonata with double subject;
and in the Kenner und Liebhaber, Vol. <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, the type
of the modern sonata appears in full development. We see
then from these examples that while Philip Emanuel uses the
<i lang="fr">reprise</i> of the first part almost universally, he is yet far removed
from the classical model of the sonata. In a word, we shall
find in him nothing that is not already to be found in Rameau,
Scarlatti, or above all, his great father.</p>

<p>The Rondo was more in accordance with his genius. Here,
where he had fully developed French models, it cannot be denied
that with all his freedom in detail he has brought the form appreciably
nearer to the classic type. Even Beethoven was often unable
to improve on his alternations of intermediate movements, or the
grace with which he returns to the air and makes his theme gently
rock to and fro. He loves those simple popular rondo airs, which,
as we listen, we all seem to have heard before. As couplets<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>prefers to use technically brilliant figures, which in their turn offer
a good contrast to the air. He is untiring in toying with the
theme. He makes it now break off in the middle, now become
sentimental; now it becomes questioning. As time goes on he
develops his whole power of expression, so that he is far removed
from a stiff alternation of theme with couplet. In a fantasia (K.
and L. v.; last piece), which is perhaps his most charming composition,
he blends the rondo-form most skilfully with the free
style of an improvisation, and thus shows himself on his best side.
Hardly less delightful is the last piece in Volume <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, a Fantasia-Rondo
whose main theme is a kind of hunting-call. In this
movement the hunt is interrupted by a beautiful romantic <i lang="it">andante</i>,
then by emotional reveries in <i lang="it">larghetto sostenuto</i>, and in the conclusion
the reflective style gains the upper hand.</p>

<p>The Rondo was so attractive to him because by its means he
was able the more easily to bring his beloved “affettuoso” into
expression. And his inner genius was not so much formal as
lyrical. In his music there is even to-day a strong spiritual charm,
to which the slight archaism adds a pleasant flavour. In his
Rondos he comes very near to us, and not less in those little
characteristic pieces which, written in dance-form, followed French
models in the very style of the inscriptions. He uses for titles
proper names, such as Hermann, Buchholz, Böhmer, Stahl; and
such more general appellations as La Xenophone, La Sibylle,
La Complaisante, La Capricieuse, L’Irrésolue, La Journalière,
and Les Langueurs Tendres—names, it will be remembered, used
also by Couperin. La Sibylle has a wonderfully beautiful melody;
and Les Langueurs Tendres is such an unsurpassable air in two
mournful voices, that it bears endless repetition. Nothing has
ever been written to surpass this tender clavichord-sadness.</p>

<p>The great counterpoint of Bach is now forgotten with extraordinary
rapidity. The ancestor of the following generation is
Philip Emanuel. Wherever we look, to the London Bach, Johann
Christian, to the Austrians—anywhere—we find the work influenced
by his style. “He is the father and we the boys,” said Mozart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Haydn knew well what he owed to Philip Emanuel, and was
as little chary to acknowledge it as Mozart. In actual essentials
Haydn made no advance in clavier-music. The stream is perhaps
a little clouded, and it is not till Mozart’s time that it again
becomes clear. Haydn’s genius lay in composing for the
orchestra, not for the piano. He has of course written clavier
sonatas—they number thirty-five—and other pieces in which the
clavier takes part; as numerous and light as the works of all
these “galant” musicians. But his trios are to be preferred to
the sonatas for piano only; there is more depth in them; and
the ideas are lit up more brightly by the instrumental combination.
Only in the sonatas after 1790, as in the first in E flat
major (Br. and H.) does something more noteworthy emerge—but
by that time Haydn had studied Mozart.</p>

<p>Still further, in his pieces, Haydn is no great virtuoso. In his
Trios he knows well how to make the most of the character of the
clavier, by contrasting it with the strings, by means of arpeggios,
all kinds of passages, full chords, and the beloved octave-melodies.
But a more interesting virtuoso performance, such as that in the
F minor variations, appears very rarely. The ornamental work
is still extensive, but within limits; and much of it is written
out in full, just as the cadenzas, which used to appear in small
notes, are now preferably printed in the usual type. At the end
of the century everything was taken away from the caprice of
the player, except the great cadenzas at the conclusion of the
concerto-movements. Philip Emanuel had taken a last important
step, when, in his Sonata dedicated to the Prussian Princess
Amalie, he wrote out exactly for the second time the ornamentations
and alterations in the frequent repetitions of musical phrases
of a few bars, instead of leaving them to the pleasure of the
players. To judge by his preface, caprice in these matters must
have flourished like a green bay-tree; and he takes great credit to
himself for having been the first to offer accurately formulated
“alternative <i lang="fr">reprises</i>,” which run no risk of spoiling the whole aim
and meaning of the piece. His point of view is interesting. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
is, he says, not possible to avoid altering a musical phrase in
repeating it. This conception is endorsed by all his contemporaries
and successors in style, in their works: Haydn and
Mozart cannot be conceived apart from this mannerism of altering
a musical idea in repetition by slight turns and adornments. This
method is the fixed law of movement of their musical ideas, and
dictates their progress through long stretches in advance. Deep
founded in the general delight in variation so characteristic of the
time, it enables us to understand that great development which
forms a whole branch of musical history—the development,
namely, of improvised “manieren” into strict and firm melodies.</p>

<p>As far as <em>form</em> is concerned, the work already begun is continued
by Haydn. The Sonata-form tends to limit itself more
and more to the first movement; more and more clearly does the
“second theme” crystallise itself; slow-drawn movements are
preferred more and more in the second place, and graceful rondo-like
movements in the third—without, however, any appearance
of compulsion. The only relic of the traditional “suite” of
dances, which Haydn retains in his sonatas or symphonies, is
the “Minuet” which he is so fond of using as an intermezzo.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
The old dance-forms, <em>as</em> dances, were so speedily forgotten, that
in a certain trio a delicate slow waltz is marked as “allemande”—whereas
the old allemande is not even written in the time of a
waltz, apart from the difference in style.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Haydn received more from the clavier than he gave to it.
He transferred to the orchestra the clavier-forms of the time, and
thus pointed out to it the path to the symphony. Without doubt
the modern symphony, in the first instance, is to be traced to the
clavier pieces of Philip Emanuel Bach; and Haydn, to whom
fell the task of the intermediary, was the first to put the rich
development of this chamber-music to practical use. Clavier and
orchestra always advance in mutual rivalry, treading on each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>other’s heels. In Haydn it was the clavier that aided the
orchestra; in Beethoven the orchestra aided the clavier; Mozart,
standing between, gives to each its own.</p>

<p>Thus it is that Mozart has given much, and much of its
special character, to the clavier. This equilibrium—and Mozart
is always the very personification of equilibrium—is most striking
in his piano-concertos, which justly enjoy the renown of having
created an epoch in this class. Especially remarkable is the
C minor concerto, in which the piano experienced one of its
chief emancipations. On one side stood the orchestra, on the
other the instrument, and yet neither of these two great rivals
loses anything of its essential nature; rather, they owe to this
very rivalry many of their best effects. When clavier and
orchestra address and answer each other; when the clavier
intertwines itself with the strings and the wood, and they in
turn blend with the clavier; when in the running strife each
sounds in its own style and gives birth to a natural variation
of phrases and to delicate alterations of the constituent forms;
all proceeds in accordance with that self-evident logic which, at
such critical points in artistic history, naturally dispenses with
internal laws.</p>

<p>Mozart is the great virtuoso who, even as a boy, was the
astonishment of Europe. It is not to be expected that he
should content himself with the intimate reflectiveness of the
pianoforte; he drags it out into the great world; he needs the
concerto-form just as he needs great concert halls. The new
pianoforte, with its fuller and more subtly expressive tones, is
precisely adapted to his aims, and he is the first to launch the
pianoforte on its decisive career. With his triumphal progresses
the popularity of the new instrument was not likely to decline.
The great enchanter leaves the tiny victories of the spinet far
behind; his public recitals in hired halls, which henceforward
become more and more popular, demand new feats. He has to
work on bold lines; he has to bring into use the special features
of the instrument he adopted; the rippling scale-passage, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
variety of tone, the <i lang="it">forte</i>, the <i lang="it">pianissimo</i>, the hundred gradations
between these extremes, the altogether new possibilities of sentimental
expression which were now at the disposal of the public
performer. But amid all the intoxication of the concert hall, the
virtuoso remains an artist; the idol of the hour retains his deeper
feeling. As he was only truly himself when, after the furore of
publicity, he touched the notes in solitude or before a few friends,
so in his concertos, behind the external glitter, a romantic soul lies
hidden. In the beautiful Romance in the D minor Concerto, for
example, the soul looks out on us with a wonderful and never-to-be-forgotten
intensity.</p>

<p>In almost all his pieces Mozart composes according to the
bidding of the moment. He is an “occasional” composer. In
the concertos the occasion was his own appearance on the
stage. In the duets and double pianoforte pieces he found the
occasion in his association with his sister. From this species of
performance he drew new effects. The D major sonata for two
pianos stands alone in the skilful and effective blending of the
two instruments. His four-handed sonatas are astonishingly
successful in the individualisation of the hands, and started a
numerous class of clavier-pieces which have been too often misused.
We shall not appreciate such duets, if we take the clavier
as a diminutive orchestra.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But here again Mozart has been
unwilling utterly to sacrifice combined effects to individual
demands.</p>

<p>Through the ravishing chamber-music in which, especially
in the quintett for oboe, clarinet, horn, fagotto and pianoforte,
the splendid treatment of the pianoforte with regard to the
wind deserves notice; through all the melodious pieces for piano
and violin, the trios, the quartetts; to the numerous smaller
clavier-pieces, the fashionable variations, the relics of the suites,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>the scattered fugues, the fantasies so rich in variety; we follow
Mozart to the eighteen pure piano sonatas, which are the very
miniature mirror of his unfailing musical invention. We shall
treat them in chronological order, for here for the first time we
perceive a distinct development which renders such treatment
the most natural and advantageous.</p>

<p>At first we meet the daring harmonies and enharmonic
changes by which every innovator makes himself notorious, and
which draw on him the first severe criticisms. But there is not
yet the concentration of later works. A light counterpoint runs
through the whole, a conscientious treatment of the themes,
which bears witness to sound training. A striking feature is
the unforced inventiveness in motives, which succeed one another
in unfailing profusion. Intellectual themes, as for example in
the B flat major, remind us of Philip Emanuel. The form
becomes more distinct, the rules of sonata-arrangement more
rigid. But it is not till we reach the A minor (1778) that the
full brilliancy of form is seen. This piece has all that wonderful
proportion and balance even in the smallest parts, which was, and
remained, Mozart’s most peculiar characteristic. Proportion in the
well-balanced opposition of themes in all three divisions, in the
liveliness of the piquant semiquaver runs, which already leave
Scarlatti far behind, in the brilliant and yet simple execution of
the last movement—proportion, indeed, is everywhere.</p>

<p>After 1778 our impressions deepen. The D major is the
creation of Mozart’s indestructible caprice. The motives become
ever more tuneful, more <em>speaking</em>: in the C major we hear the
phrases as though sung; we seem to hear words with pauses
for breath, as from a distant exquisite opera. The melodies
run after each other, and—what is so typical a feature of Mozart—it
is by this that our attention is held rather than by any inner
development of the themes.</p>

<p>The A major sonata is an excellent example of this melodic
regularity. Its contours are of an unimagined loveliness, and
its airs of a magic delicacy. The Turkish March stands out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
variegated national colours, far removed from every triviality—if
only we give to the Janissary rhythm its full due.</p>

<p>The airs become broader, the piquancies more daring, until
the allegretto of the B flat major with its jubilant sevenths
stands before us as a new peak of Philip Emanuel’s Rondo forms.
Here is that bright laughter, which from Mozart’s lips has the
most delightful of sounds.</p>

<p>This was in 1779. In 1784 Mozart has entered upon the
second half of his life, the unhappy half, and the C minor sonata
appears. New tones now strike upon our ear, harsh, strong,
broad, intense. But all is still in proportion. The hand is
freer, rushing more boldly from the heights of the piano to its
depths; bolder also are the episodes which are the pivots of the
thoughts. In all is the sweet intoxication in the bewildering sound
of the pianoforte, and the air so full of soul, growing richer in
retardations, and more and more taking the lines which Mozart
decisively fixed for the beautifully-formed melody. A strange
reserve, the reserve of maturity, characterises the last movement,
otherwise so flowing; its expressive raggedness forbodes new things,
the victory of matter over form—in a word, Beethoven; and then,
in this period of Figaro and Don Giovanni, we meet the F major,
the most sombre in content of all his writings (1788). With its
two movements we are accustomed, not improperly, to connect
the Rondo written in 1786. Counterpoint has slowly advanced to
its old position—the sign of the mature man, who is seeking his
fixed abode. This it is which stiffens the weft into what at times
is a solidity worthy of Bach. The dominion over the world of
tone is now absolute, the melodies sing heavenward, as for
example in the theme of this andante, which came spontaneously
from his soul.</p>

<p>We have reached the limit of the “galant,” over whose fields
dark clouds are already gathering. But we are also at its highest
point. In Mozart the ideal of popular music was more fully
realised than its father, Philip Emanuel, could ever have dreamed.
Mozart’s well-balanced nature preserved the clavier from superficiality;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and he himself was saved by an early death from
sacrificing this balance to the sombre thought of a new time.
His sense for form brought the sonata into more typical shape,
but the endless melody and the free intelligence of his music took
all sharpness from the forms. No music can be less easily
described in words than his; and therefore, as a great beautiful
sound, it was the best content which the forms of the galant
popular epoch could find. It is not till we have left youth behind
that we see proportion and equilibrium in this repose; and it is
then, as Otto Jahn says, that we are amazed at the wonderful
wealth of this art and at ourselves for being so slow to feel it.</p>

<h3>Beethoven</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> a great scheme was started in Berlin for a common
monument to Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, it was plain to
see that the artists felt themselves in the presence of a very
mixed task; but it was not so clear where the incongruity lay.
They stood under the influence of the popular opinion, which
binds these three heroes under a single yoke, and they were
the victims of this influence. Nations have an instinct of
symmetry in the classification of their great men. The ancients<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
had their seven sages; to-day we are content with two or three;
but even so the combinations are none the less strained. The
false ideas due to the pairing of Bach and Handel, or of Goethe
and Schiller, are hardly to be numbered. The triumvirate of
Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, is the very acme of perversity.
Haydn and Mozart, though two fundamentally different natures,
have yet in common the similar features of the age. But Beethoven
is as little like them as Goethe is like Racine. We have
only to glance round a salon in the Vienna of the last century.
The old Haydn and the old Salieri sit smiling and friendly on a
sofa; they move in the stilted fashion of the eighteenth century;
they retain in their carriage all the features of the “Zopf und
Schopf”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> period; and in every judgment, in every gesture, they
show their antagonism to unrestrained emotion. Over against
them a young man is leaning on the piano. His demeanour is
modish though untidy, and smacks of the Rhine; his movements
natural but wooden; his hair is loose and disordered; his compliments
are few; he accepts strangers only on compulsion; his
playing is perhaps too vigorous, too full of feeling; and the ideas
which he incorporates in his works are in their originality half
revolutionary, half romantic. This new-comer is Beethoven, a
man so different from the settled type, from the old “composers
of the Empire,” as he himself calls them, that it is easy to anticipate
the future which he himself is conjuring up. He is the
first of the Titans, the first of the great fragmentary natures, the
first tone-artist who breaks the forms of music to pieces on the
iron of his emotions. A strange Providence closes his outward
ears, and thus gaining a clearer vision, he receives from Nature
herself unheard-of inspirations. How this strange new man,
this romantic raver, could be coupled with Haydn and Mozart
is a wonder; but popular opinion accounts for it. Beethoven
came to Vienna just as Mozart began to be missed. The world
gave him the honour of attaching him to the classic school.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>But it is a mere blunder to treat him as the end of an epoch—he
is the beginning of a new one.</p>

<p>It must be observed at this point that the world had meanwhile
become really musical—or perhaps less truly musical than
music-loving. Nay, more; political events, as formerly church
ceremonies, could now be celebrated in music. The famous
concerto which Beethoven gave in honour of the Vienna Congress
was perhaps the first great occasion on which music lent
itself in festal manner to the adornment of public events.
It was now no longer a mere incident in a commemorative
display, but to a great extent pure music; and the rapid and
vigorous education of men to instrumental music by the classical
masters was the necessary precedent condition of the attainment
of this point. In these matters the clavier played its important
part as an intermediary and a teacher; it made the innovations
into current coin, scattered them among people in their homes,
and accustomed their ears to understand better and better the
absolute language of music, as it dealt in wider and wider
abstractions. The publishers were more active, the issues more
frequent, the popular settings more numerous and artistic. Even
the great men themselves take a share in the work. A frequent
phenomenon in the music-trade is that composers like Clementi,
Dussek, and Pleyel, themselves open publishing houses—and
secure the advertisement of their wares, oftener perhaps than was
really necessary.</p>

<p>International exchange became more active year by year. If
we look to London, we see Johann Christian Bach at work, helping
to give form to the Sonata; we observe Haydn and Pleyel in
vigorous rivalry for the favour of the public; we see the virtuoso
Clementi from Italy setting up a clavier-school. In Petersburg
meanwhile lives the Englishman, Field, one of the chief nocturne-romancists,
and Klengel and Berger, the Germans, all three brought
out by Clementi. Next we see there also J. W. Hässler, the ex-hatter,
who has left behind such agreeable works that Bülow
regarded him as a good intermediary between Mozart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Beethoven. In Paris the opera is the favourite agent of musical
pleasure. With Gluck the old quarrel between the Italian and
the northern manner is renewed. Chamber-music retreats into
the back-ground. Schobert and Eckard, decorative musicians,
are hardly known beyond the border; and Adam and Kalkbrenner,
who restore the fame of French clavier-technique, leave
productive art on one side.</p>

<p>In Vienna there is a swarm of prominent figures. Gradually
the city is preparing itself for the state of things which in 1820
W. C. Müller thus describes in one of his “Letters to German
Friends”: “It is incredible how far the enthusiasm for music, and
especially for skill on the piano, is now being carried. Every
house has a good instrument. The banker Gaymüller has five
by different makers; and the girls especially play a great deal.”
Indeed, a glance at the society of Vienna at that time shows us
innumerable ladies, ranging from the merest amateurs to the
maturest artistic performers, thronging round the great and the
mediocre alike. Even Beethoven, the misanthrope, sees himself
surrounded by them; he cannot keep from them, nay, he often
does not choose to do so. The Baroness Ertmann, Julia Guicciardi,
Nanette Streicher, are some of the actual persons of the fair
sex, who, amid innumerable legendary beings, hovered about the
Master. As usual where social life forms the basis of culture, the
ladies come to the front. Invitations fly in bewildering profusion;
the great houses exchange their guests; new compositions are
made known in the salons before they find a publisher; and
when they are published, old acquaintances become subscribers.
This narrow circle gives a great opportunity for the advance of
chamber-music. An accurate observer will notice how the modern
international musical public slowly develops itself from this old-fashioned,
close corporation.</p>

<p>The names of the best teachers are in every mouth. Czerny,
who was destined to raise Vienna technique to its height, and to
become the teacher of a Liszt, tells us in his Memoirs who were
known as the best teachers in Vienna at the commencement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the century: “Wölffl, distinguished by his bravura-playing;
Gelinek, universally popular for his brilliant and elegant execution;
Lipawsky, a great sight-player, renowned for his performance
of Bach’s fugues. I still remember how Gelinek once told
my father that he was invited out for an evening to break a
lance with a foreign player. ‘We mean to hew him in pieces,’
said Gelinek. Next day my father asked Gelinek how the
fight of yesterday had gone. ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘I shall remember
yesterday’s fight. The young man has a devil. I never heard
such playing. He improvised fantasias on an air I gave him,
as I never heard even Mozart improvise. Then he played
compositions of his own, which are in the highest degree
wonderful and grand, and he brings out of the piano effects
the like of which we never heard of!’ ‘Ah,’ said my father,
astonished, ‘what is this man called?’ ‘He is,’ said Gelinek,
‘a little, gloomy, dark, and stubborn-looking young fellow, and
he is called Beethoven.’”</p>

<p>Beethoven was discontented. He knew what lay within
him, and yet could not help seeing how the crowd preferred
to shout itself hoarse over the brilliant exponents of technique,
then beginning to swarm over Vienna. He was brought into a
contest not only with Gelinek, but with Wölffl, who was renowned
for his abnormally long fingers. Such contests are a
mark of the times. As yet the division of labour between
composers and interpreters had not been introduced. Playing
and invention had a more intimate association. The following
is the programme of the “Academy,” which Mozart performed
in 1770 at Mantua: “First, a symphony of his own composition;
secondly, a pianoforte concerto, which he will play at
sight; thirdly, a sonata just placed before him, which he will
provide with variations and afterwards repeat in another key.
Then he will compose an aria to words given to him, sing it
himself, and accompany it on the clavier. Next, a sonata for
the cembalo on a motive supplied him by the first violin<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>strict fugue on a theme to be selected, which he will improvise
on the piano; a trio, in which he will take the violin part <i lang="it">all’improviso</i>;
and, finally, the last symphony of his own composition.”
No sharper contrast can be conceived than this
performance offers to the modern concert. Almost all is here
arranged for sight-playing and improvisation, or for the instantaneous
exertion of inventive or executant skill. There is
in this still a good deal of the earlier notion of music, in which
the conception and visible development of a theme was preferred
to the performance of a completed work. Later, the demand for
such instantaneous performances gradually disappears. In Mozart
the cadenza at the conclusion of the concerto-movements remained
as the last refuge of the improviser in the written-out piece. Beethoven
insisted that his E flat major concerto should be performed
without an improvised cadenza.</p>

<p>At a period in which instantaneous performances were so
popular, contests of the kind mentioned above were not misplaced.
But Beethoven had more to suffer in them than others,
since his genius had already outgrown them. He was a poet who
loved to live apart and to offer his gifts in a more intimate fashion.
How wonderfully did that very deafness, which turned his genius
inward, preserve him in later years from public playing and conducting!
But, before, he had been forced to enter the lists not
only with Wölffl, with Gelinek, with the renowned technist
Hummel, but actually with so contemptible an artist as Steibelt.
This Steibelt was one of the disgraces of the age. Bespattered
with praise, he rushed through Europe with his trashy compositions,
his battles, thunder-storms, Bacchanals, which he
played <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>, while his wife struck the tambourine in
concert with him. The populace was enraptured, for Steibelt
and Madame tickled their nerves with sparkling shakes and
tremolos. At the house of the Count von Fries he fell in with
Beethoven. A quintett of Steibelt’s and the B flat major trio
of Beethoven’s (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 11) were played. In the latter occur the
variations on a theme of Weigl, from the opera L’Amor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Marinaro. Beethoven was out of humour and would not play.
A week later the same company met again. On this occasion
a quintett by Steibelt is again played, and to it Steibelt adds
a series of wild clattering variations on the same theme of
Weigl. Such “Leit-motive” attacks are familiar in these contests.
It is well known that underlying Mozart’s Zauberflöte overture
is a theme which Clementi had already used in his B flat major
Sonata. Clementi had played it in a contest with Mozart, who
did not care much for the Italian “mechanical” artist. But
Beethoven this time avenged himself bitterly on Steibelt. After
a long persuasion from his friends he stepped negligently to the
piano, struck with one finger a few notes from the just-played
quintett, and twisted it in and out until he had produced a
fantasia; but Steibelt, before the conclusion of the piece, left
the room and never came near him again.</p>

<p>Thus Beethoven lived in a world with which he had no
sympathy. It is true that there were some houses in which
the higher class of music was openly cultivated. Such a house
was that of Van Swietens, where Beethoven often played to a
late hour from Bach’s Wohltemperiertes Klavier. But the
multitude, whose musical horizon was bounded by the Italian
opera, occupied itself with the glitter and splash of the executants.
In such a city old Diogenes might have sought
long for a man. A composer of the best class, Friedrich
Wilhelm Rust, who in the midst of his capriccios in the style
of Philip Emanuel often showed features reminding us of
Beethoven, died at Dessau in 1796 alone and inglorious. A
Franz Schubert lived close by Beethoven, but no one knew of
his existence. Those who are heard of are virtuosos and writers
for the pianoforte. Dussek, however, is of importance not only
from the technical point of view, but from that of true <em>art</em>.
He is noteworthy also as the first musician to compose almost
wholly for the piano, with or without accompaniment. How
distant are the times when we could feel surprise when a piece
appeared written for piano alone! And this man, within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
limits of his genius, made the poetry of the piano into a life-work.
It is as if for the first time an anticipation of Chopin
rose before us; but the likeness is after all only in externals.
Dussek is the bourgeois romancist, when he spends his whole
year in the country with his lady-love; but he is the true son
of the eighteenth century when he in turn attaches himself to
successive princely patrons. Especially devoted was he to the
musical Prussian Prince Louis Ferdinand, on whose death at
Saalfeld he wrote a suitable composition. His style would
seem to have been noble and full, and his pieces are more
charming than was usual at the time. Unlike Hummel he was
very partial to the pedal; and it is in his pages, perhaps, that
we find it for the first time accurately employed. His works
themselves are of all kinds and degrees of merit. When, led
by his national temperament (he was a Czech), he gives full
play to the dance forms in the last movement, he strikes a fine
and fresh note. He was one of the first to use syncopations
effectively. But he has also written a final movement, that of
the E flat major sonata in 6/8 time, which has a true and solid
worth over and above its dance-form. He is less attentive to
his first movements, and his most famous sonata, that in A flat
major, which he entitled “Retour à Paris,” disappoints in this
regard our expectations. In his second movements he is quicker
to light on tones which, by their tender character, linger in the
memory; as above all in the slow movement of the D major in
2/4 time.</p>

<p>After all, if Dussek does not stand among the immortals, he
yet, in intellect and power of invention, ranks among the lesser
stars<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> to whom we owe the full elaboration of the popular forms.
His style is soon grasped. We know one of his sonatas already
as soon as we hear the first bars. A broad first theme gives us a
good tune; then it goes smoothly flowing through grateful passages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>to the second theme in
the dominant or relative key.
Other runs give the fingers
some further opportunity for
bravura; perhaps a third scrap
of melody peeps out, and we
are at the landmark of the first
double bar. Next some suitable
free fantasia is arranged,
which sounds more scholastic
than it is; we pass with it
through a series of related
keys—until a motive already
known, the first theme, brings
us back again with a smooth
glide to the beginning, from
which point the movement practically repeats itself. In the
following movements there is a longer melody adorned with
variations. In the third a seductively familiar theme tickles
our fancy, which at times spreads itself out in bravuras, or gives
itself effect in a very poor imitation of a fugue.</p>

<p>In company such as this Beethoven stands absolutely alone.
It is true he has not yet wholly cast off the garment of his time.
In many a harmonic phrase, in many a formal turn, he is a child
of the period; above all in many a <i lang="fr">naiveté</i>. And he not seldom
exerts himself about passages which are utterly unworthy of him.
He, the composer of the A major symphony, wrote at the same
time the incredible “Battle of Vittoria.” Conscious advance, such
as Wagner set before himself, is to him unknown; and we find
among his later works various things that remind us of an earlier
period, as, for example, the wonderfully Mozart-like C major
Rondo for the pianoforte. But his <i lang="fr">naiveté</i> was strangely warped;
and thus arose noteworthy mixtures of style, such as we so often
observe in men who stand on the borders of two ages. His
character was the most complicated that ever musician had; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
only investigators who know not the demon of the great soul, can
seriously ascribe the paltry avarice of the master to humane goodwill
for the notorious nephew whom he supported. A soul like
Beethoven’s is a mystery into which we can only penetrate slowly
and with difficulty; and who knows—even if perhaps the deepest
secrets of his “last style” should become common and familiar,
whether even then the last word would have been said on this
strangely complicated and distorted character? But Beethoven
composed from the soul outward. This was the great novelty. And
we must penetrate into his soul if we will rightly apprehend him.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic compiler, Thayer, who died while writing
Beethoven’s biography—musical history has often been the death of
its authors!—remarks very excellently how differently from others
Beethoven already sketches out his work. The motives stand there
in hasty cursive—applications of motives—tone-ideas in words—as
a painter sketches or a poet notes down his observations or inspirations.
It bubbles up not like Bach’s steady stream of self-restraint,
but in a torrent of unmeasured passion, which regards self-restraint
as a weak concession and the correctness of the “galants” as a lie.
In this man music spoke in words, not in pictures. He had the
unparalleled boldness to tear out his secret feelings, all bleeding as
they were, and hold them up before his own gaze. It was the
boldness of a Zarathustra-nature. He belonged to those who
worship Bacchus, not to those who follow Buddha. In Thayer’s
possession was a note from Beethoven to his friend Zmeskall of
Domanovecz. “For the future I bid farewell to the cheerfulness
which I sometimes enjoy; for yesterday, through your Zmeskallic
chatter, I became quite gloomy. The devil take them—I don’t
want to know anything of their universal morality. Might is the
morality of men who distinguish themselves above others. It is
my morality, anyhow. If you start on me again, I shall pester
you until you find everything I do noble and praiseworthy.”</p>

<p>We shall then only understand Beethoven thoroughly when
we leave form on one side and take music as a speech. It is no
feeble paradox to say that the reason why Beethoven, in his operas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and songs, paid so little attention to the words, was because the
music was to him words enough. To this greatest of instrumental
geniuses was revealed the great secret of pure music, which,
precisely because it has no speech or language, speaks infinitely
the more profoundly. Words obstruct it. When Beethoven, at
the end of the Ninth Symphony, has recourse to the human voice,
everyone feels that it was to him only the highest of all instruments,
with which he can do yet more than with trombone or
contrabass. It is the utmost triumph of the pure musician who
can draw even the voice under his sway.</p>

<p>Music is to him a speech, because it is full of associations of
ideas, which bring tones into relation with the outer world, and
make them reverberate with a thousand inner meanings. In his
orchestra we hear nature, as in his pianoforte we hear the orchestra.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Not without reason has Bülow, in his edition of Beethoven, in
more than one place translated the piano-piece for the reader
into score, in order to make its content clearer. These are things
which did not exist in Bach. The world of tone has sacrificed her
great unity for the great fragmentariness of unveiled speech, and
a never dreamt-of height was thus reached in that absolute tone
speech, which formerly in Venice and in England had taken the
place of the mediæval vocal music.</p>

<p>What a Gabrieli, a Bull, a Bird, a Couperin, each in his own
way, had begun, was by Beethoven brought to full completion.
Here was the perfect opposition to the Middle Ages. Here was
the Michael Angelo who could stand alone against the ancients.
The abstractions were perfected, the relations more general, the
language more intelligible. If Beethoven began his first Symphony
with a chord of the seventh, it was possible to understand what
he meant by it. To this man, who completed one epoch in
beginning another; to this symphonist and chamber-musician, the
clavier must become a daily necessity. His life has been written
in his works. Words, which could only fetter him, are kept at a
distance; the notes tell the story by themselves.</p>

<p>If we would understand Beethoven’s language we must study
the way in which he works out his motives. His peculiarities are
the peculiarities of the naturalistic school. The melody mounts or
falls as his emotion mounts or falls. He takes a motive and
narrows it until its parts curve upon each other, and then again
makes it greater and broader, until it lies open before us. This is
a deep and mysterious language, which deals with the tones as a
word, an expression; which looks on us, shall I say? like the eye
of certain animals—we understand them through and through, and
yet their speech is not ours. But the most powerful agent in stirring
our emotion is the rhythm, that soul of all expression. It is
the absolute pulse of things, which only the finer ears can hear in
the outer world; it lies here before us in its artistic purity. The
pauses, the leaps, the syncopations, the gigantic parallelisms of
structure, the dynamic surprises, leave but a thin wall of partition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
between the phenomenal and the transcendental of music. There
is no longer any reserve in the language. There are some movements
in which Beethoven’s music stands at the very doors of
verbal speech: such, for example, as the allegretto in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 14, 1
and the first movement of <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 90. The words appear to tremble
on the lips; but it would be the disappearance of the apparition
were we to utter them.</p>

<p>Over Beethoven’s realm broods a deep tragedy. A constraining
seriousness speaks to us—the dark abyss of passionate emotion:
a total pitilessness, a gloomy brooding, accents of misery, a unison
of terror. Beethoven began his piano publications with the three
sonatas (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 2.) dedicated to Haydn; works full of inexhaustible
inspirations, of the ravishing freshness of youth. The second is
introduced by sharp accents and those broad extensions of chords
by means of octaves, which remained to the end characteristic of
the author. Another man would have begun the piece <em>after</em> this
tragic cry, with the contrapuntally-rocking motive. But the
first of his greater tragic outbreaks was the mighty Sonata in C
minor, the so-called Pathétique, which he dedicated to his patron
Lichnowsky. Upon the heavy, slow introductory passage follows
the stormy First Movement, whose themes are, first, a tempest of
rage, secondly, an utter despair; and the Grave intrudes its
monitory remembrances in the midst. Unity of colouring is preserved.
Over the second singing movement, and the third with its
rondo-like passages, lies the same sombre tone; and the conclusion
is sharply cut short.</p>

<p>Beethoven revels in the gloomy. He buries himself in deep
tones, as in the Andante of the Pathétique or in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 22, its cheerfulness
notwithstanding. Later, on the magnificent Broadwood,
which he received from England as a present, he goes with delight
into the regions of the deep. A mystic tremolo attracts him; and
the “trios” of his scherzi are full of the sonorous murmuring of
billowy chords.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
A new and grand expression of pain is the last movement of
the Moonlight Sonata (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 27, 2), which is as full of hopelessness
as the last movement of the other Sonata of this great pair (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr>
27, 1) is full of invigoration. The threatening strokes of the quaver
chords which sharply define each repetition of the stormy motive-passages,
the quivering secondary theme, the unrestful rests, the
melodies, which seek to calm down the seething bass; all this was
a world of seriousness which the clavier had not yet learned to
know.</p>

<p>But this was still a <em>composition</em>, compared with the naturalistic
chaos of the Recitative Sonata (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 31, 2). This first movement
is a remarkable embodiment of gloomy brooding, which is continually
being disturbed by despairing cries, until it finally loses
itself in that resignation of utter indifference, which is a typical
form of Beethoven’s tragic finales.</p>

<p>It seems to me beyond question that the impulse which drove
Beethoven to compose great piano-pieces was supplied by the
concerto-form. The concerto, in its secular character, had not
remained without its advantages; it was broader and freer than
the regular sonata. It avoids <i lang="fr">reprises</i> in the first movement, and
arranges the divisions with more circumspection. In order to give
the clavier-player a chance to rest, the orchestra must take over
some independent parts. It begins with a broadly planned
section, which so to say arouses curiosity, in which various themes
are treated; and portions of this introduction are then inserted
between the successive entries of the pianoforte, or even simultaneously
with them. The piano itself appears usually three
times. In the first and last of these the music is to some extent
repetition, the intermediate section is a kind of free fantasia. Even
in Mozart a strict unity of theme between the orchestral and the
solo sections is not always to be observed; it was Beethoven who
first carried it thoroughly out. He it was who with visible affection
fashioned the concerto form. It is no accident that the two last
of his pianoforte concertos, the G major and E flat major, to-day
enjoy an exuberant popularity. What Mozart had promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in his C minor concerto, these perform to admiration. They are
built entirely on that plastic sensuousness which is the essence and
the aim of the concerto. Their themes are remarkably adapted
for a polyphonous orchestral development, for a delicate imitation
on the piano, or for the storm of the fullest harmonies.</p>

<p>The technique, whether of the piano or of the orchestral
colouring, though joyous, is yet severe. Far from all coquetry and
all mere show—the technique stands, especially in the cheerful
E flat major, on a height of extraordinary purity. The form is
clear, but not so precise as not to admit of modifications in single
sections, especially those devoted to the solo instrument. The
intellectual G major, the technical E flat major, represented an
extreme of happy sympathetic innovation.</p>

<p>We only need to compare the great Waldstein Sonata in C
major (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 53) with the Concertos, in order at once to see that the
latter have stood godfather to the former. There are not merely
external likenesses, as when the piano figures a theme which
might have been played already on the orchestra, or when more
important divisions close with a long shake, as in all concertos
the piano sections usually do on the re-entrance of the tutti; or
when with passages played pianissimo, and hurrying ghostlike, or
in octaves, an effect is introduced which in Beethoven’s concertos
the delicate piano is generally used to play out in contrast with
the orchestra. Rather the important likeness lies in the whole
broad outline. The themes appear as a rule twice, as is naturally
the case in the concerto; the exposition is done leisurely and
cheerfully; a cadenza, such as Beethoven had already used (<i>e.g.</i>,
in Opp. 2, 3, and 27, 2), gives to the conclusion of the first movement
a specially concerto-like quality. The second slow movement
is a short emotional transition, such as Beethoven has written
so exquisitely in the G major and E flat major concertos; and
the last movement, far from being a “concession” to the “light-robed”
muse, is a spirited rondo, in brilliant style it is true, but
in its augmentations and diminutions, its <i lang="it">stretto</i> and the trill-conclusion,
a genuine Beethoven—as no other could be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
As thus the dependence on the broad effects to which the
concerto style had accustomed the hearer, gave to the first movement
of the sonata a new form and extent which it had hitherto
not known, it was possible for Beethoven to infuse into it a tragic
content which soars far above the general coloration of the “Pathétique”
and the brooding naturalism of the “Recitative” Sonata.
Here for the first time we hear those trumpet-calls to the battle
with Fate, those heavy rolling waves at the return to the first
theme, which later in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 111 found so concentrated an expression.
A monumental epic develops itself about the conflict, which
usually forms the content of first movements. This mighty form
represents a mighty picture.</p>

<p>What was thus given in the Waldstein was deepened and
unified in the Appassionata (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 57). The uniform colouring of
the Pathétique is here deepened by hints taken from the concerto.
A sublime and rhythmical theme, based upon the simplest harmony,
a solemn unison, dominates the first movement. The second
theme, lyrical as it appears, is really only fashioned out of the
first. As the movement progresses, we seem to hear mysterious
winds, stormy seas, convulsions of nature. A cadenza, straight
from the heart, leads to the most colossal <i lang="it">stretto</i> ever written:
a wild upheaving, a sudden down-sinking and extinction. Its
spiritual connection with the choral-like andante con moto is
obvious. The note of aspiration is heard throughout, first by
pauses, then by a clearer and clearer expression in those deeply-felt
variations, which finally repeat their theme. The despair of
the final movement is the last act—a giant melody, uttered in
piercing cries, sinking down panting in the middle, and at the end
breaking out into Bacchanalian revelry, in which laughter and
ruin are inextricably mingled.</p>

<p>This was the most comprehensive tragic picture ever drawn
by Beethoven on the piano; and it has therefore remained a
unique composition. His works tell us that he outgrew the epoch
in which misery is enjoyed. His tragic art leads us beyond
despair not to Nirvana, but to the Elysian fields. Hymns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
joy sound around him. Strong joy, Dionysian strength, was the
aim of this Faust. What he once depicted in the wonderful monologue
of <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 27, 1, becomes his life. In the Elysian Fields the
fugue of adolescence returns to him, giving him repose and safety.
In it he allows the tragedy of <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 106 to tower heavenwards. Or,
ethereal, world-dissolving glories shine around him—these are the
bright, cheerful phrases of the E major or A flat major Sonatas, in
which they now give the theme, now the figuration, or in the
scherzo, grow up in flowery profusion. Into this serenity he allows
the tragedy of the last Sonata (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 111) to pass at last. After
a movement of wild outcry come the simply resigned variations,
which finally mount from dull earthly devotion to angelic harmonies,
to end in the glitter of their smile, in the bright sphere of
their unearthliness.</p>

<p>To understand the joyous Beethoven of later years we must
remember the capricious Beethoven of youth. A strong leaven of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
cheerfulness lay in him, a healthy will, which knew how to be
humorous.</p>

<p>The sportive Beethoven lies in the lap of Nature. There he
hears the entrancing imitations of his Haydn Sonatas, the hurrying
ghost-like scherzo with its Schubert-like romantic middle movement
(<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10, 2), the sparkling Rondo of the Variation Sonata.
This we must hear played by Risler in order to appreciate its
inimitable humour and poetry, which is based entirely on the soft
touch of the contrary motions. The most perfect of Nature
prayers, a Pastoral Symphony on the pianoforte, is the <cite>Pastorale</cite>
(<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 28). Not only the second movement with its bird-like middle
part; nor only the third with its extreme cheerfulness, nor the
fourth with its outlook on the woods, its delight in the chase, its
joyous conclusion; but also, and in the highest degree, the first
movement, are confessions of Beethoven’s natural symbolism. This
work stands on that indefinable border-line between the comic and
the tragic, which is the unfailing mark of the intensest poetry. It
is a complete picture of the world. Beethoven’s scherzi, his most
peculiar form of art, which in the Sonata take the place of the old
minuets, stand on this ground, and might be termed “secular,” in
comparison with the dramatic embodiments of his first movements,
or the complete picturings of the last.</p>

<p>The Rondos exhibit a similar process of alteration. In them
first, so early as the time of Philip Emanuel Bach, had the capacity
of tonic art to “let a theme speak,” been exercised. They allowed
a theme its full expressive value. To Beethoven, accordingly, in
his first period, such rondos appealed with the strongest effect, and
their charming melodies throng in his earlier sonatas. But he was
able to give this form a still deeper meaning. In place of the
melodies he adopts genuine motives of pregnant brevity, which, as
in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10, 3, he develops with characteristic reserve. These pieces,
as contrasted with the old melodic rondo, show a convincing
naturalism. To the old rondo they are related as his scherzo to
the minuet. Equally significant is his love for certain diatonically
moving accompaniment figures, as in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 14, 1, or <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 28; he thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
avoids the impression of a regularly harmonised theme, and allows
the naturalistic motive to predominate over the formal melody.</p>

<p>In the treatment of form in general, the sonatas exhibit a
series of different experiments, which are of emotional interest.
His other chamber music—the Violin Sonatas, the Trios, and all
the rest, to which I now only allude—could not accomplish the
suppression of form like the free, pure piano-pieces. The great
Fantasia for chorus, orchestra, and piano (the latter treated in
concerto fashion), which we value as an anticipation of the Ninth
Symphony, was unique in its disregard of rule. Psychologically
viewed, the sonata-form is much richer in content, and unravels the
most wonderful mazes. Here is the history of the re-constituted
sonata-form; a history which is too complicated to run in a
straight line.</p>

<p>Down to <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10 on the whole we stand on the classical ground
of the sonata. In the three Sonatas, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10, appear the first
important irregularities. Both in the first and in the second
Sonatas there is, in the “free” part, a quite new theme introduced,
which points to a definite design; and in the third we find that
wonderful D minor movement, with its utter abandonment to
melancholy, which by means of a stretto<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> in the Largo raises itself
absolutely out of the contemporary style. Yet all this was new
only in tone; it was no more absolutely new in idea than the
Grave of the Pathétique or the Variation Sonata with its Marcia
Funebre, where the middle section is introduced by means of
realistic drum-reverberations.</p>

<p>An essential change is to be observed in the two sonatas <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 27.
We are at the beginning of the nineteenth century, not far from
the time of the composition of the Eroica Symphony. Beethoven
was fully conscious of the freedom of these sonatas (E flat major
and C sharp minor): he inscribed both “Sonata quasi una fantasia.”
In the E flat major a dainty andante movement meets us,
whose voices are strongly interwoven. It develops itself slightly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>in variation manner, but it is interrupted, once by a sustained
melody, again by a stormy episode in C major. What has become
of the rondo with its couplets? There follows the apparition of a
rolling, beating, gigantic scherzo, beginning in C minor and ending
in C major. The C (always <i lang="it">attacca subito</i>) prepares us for the
bright A flat major adagio, which gently takes us up till the whole
idea is exhausted. Finally we have the wholesome, powerful, and
busy E flat major movement, arranged in free rondo-form, with its
stirring reminiscences of the adagio. The twin sonata in C sharp
minor is the so-called Moonlight, with its classical first movement,
which was a unique expression of melancholy; and which, only
slightly interrupted by the episodic allegretto, breaks out again
into the despair of the presto agitato, which we have learnt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
know as one of the most deeply tragical of Beethoven’s outbursts.
Of a sonata as a regular composition there was here no further idea.
These were transcripts from experiences.</p>

<p>The experiences of Beethoven’s life in the following period, so
far as they are recorded in the diary of the piano-sonatas, exhibit a
certain archaic character. In this period from 1803-4 (the period
of <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 31) to 1811 (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 81 a) lie the most varied tendencies in
confusion. It is a mighty attempt in all possible paths, but the
reader will soon see that every path leads to a definite goal. In
all the paths there is an attempt to grasp certain great elementary
principles, which lie outside the direct development, and which are
made subservient to the new spirit.</p>

<p>This archaism of form appears first as an application of old
forms to modern purposes. In the G major (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 31, 1) we are
surprised by strange retrogressions—which yet are not mere
retrogressions. The rosy coloration of the adagio draws past
recollections into new life. The third movement shows us Bach’s
application of the pedal bass, transfigured by passing through the
mind of Beethoven. In <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 31, 3 the minuet returns again, and
in other passages, with their simply-cut melodies on “Alberti”
basses<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> we seem to have gone back a generation. In the “easy”
sonata (Op. 49) and the “Ländler” (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 79) this tendency reaches
its height. It is a return to nature; a growth of simplicity, in all
points, however trifling; the reaction experienced by every mature
genius. Beethoven never wholly lost this tendency to reaction.
He became in his later days more Mozartian than he had been
even in his youth, and more of a Bach than Bach himself.</p>

<p>The second path leads us back not to the form but to the
essential nature of Beethoven’s youthful period. The delicate
work of the porcelain age lives again in him; above all in the
charming F sharp major Sonata, of which he himself was so fond.
It is quite extraordinary how in Beethoven the spirit of a past
time receives life under astonishingly new forms. This graceful
filigree-work, with its sweeping unearthly conclusion in the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>section,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> built entirely on delicate inspirations, piquant harmonies,
dainty modulations—has wonderfully shot up in such colour, as
autumn blossoms only can offer. Take next the famous Les
Adieux, dedicated to his pupil, the Archduke Rudolf (E flat
major). It shows a delight in the minute and the intimate, such
as we meet in old Dutch pictures. There is not a passing-note,
not a modulation, which was not worked under the magnifying
glass. I should myself not like to omit the last movement, known
as the “Wiedersehen.”</p>

<p>The beautiful characteristics of the “Absence” Sonata are
well known; the various metamorphoses of the three descending
notes, more or less obvious, but always helping to enlarge the
meaning of the first idea [see, for instance, in the first Adagio,
bar 7; also the bass of each phrase from bar 10 (third quaver)
to the first double bar; then in the Allegro, bars 19-21, in the bass,
and the semibreves just before the repeat; also in the “free” part
after the repeat mark; and 13 bars from the end of the movement,
left hand, etc.], the meaning of a dreary longing, which Beethoven
tries to portray in the “Lebewohl” movements. The tender
expression of the Andante, the trembling joy and almost overpowering
delight of the “Wiedersehen,” the sweet charm of the
delicate prolongation of this movement at the <i lang="it">Poco andante</i> near
the close, all these cannot but deserve mention here. Of course
there was nothing new in having three movements labelled with
such names as these. What <em>was</em> new was the inner unity which
was attained in this piece, and which was only equalled by the
delicacy of the workmanship itself. To this (so to speak) archaic
and delicate style was added the world-embracing Art which found
its proper field in the C major (Waldstein, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 53) and the F minor
(Appassionata, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 57) sonatas. Thus was the proper foundation
laid for the grandiose poems of the last six Sonatas, which lead
the three streams into one course.</p>

<p>The first of these (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 90) is in two movements, like the last:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>the first, a thoughtful and restful movement without reprise, with a
new motive in its development; the second, a slow rondo, embracing
the parts of the theme fugally. It is a work which, like all
these last sonatas, is never thought of as a “piece,” but stands before
us in one transparency, laying bare the inmost fibres of the man.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 101 an unparalleled height of thematic development is
attained. Rhythmical motives are plentiful; the smoothly flowing
six-eight time; the same with accent completely displaced (as in
bar 29, etc.); the vigorous dotted quaver and semiquaver of the
Vivace; the prominent formula of the section in B flat in the
same movement, etc. As before in the Appassionata, the boundaries
between first and second themes fade away before the consciousness
of their unity. The Sonata exhibits thematic in all
its forms. The fugue half changes into the rondo, free in expression,
lively in character. An unearthly sweep of music, born
tone by tone, rolls over us; the <em>e a</em> of the motive is its air-built
scaffolding. It is the streaming forth of the most inward intuition
of tone; a special kind of absolute naturalism, which yet enfolds
in itself the future of music. We think of the “Bagatelles,” which
Beethoven wrote and published at this time, cabinet-pieces of
remarkably genuine character.</p>

<p>Then suddenly rises before us the “Grand Sonata” (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 106).
We recognise no longer the old well-known features. It has
assumed the forms of the giant-world; it laughs in its greatness,
in its childlikeness. Will it really permit itself to be played by
human hands? We are at the mysterious limits of piano-music.
Rhythms marked by sharp blows, modulations in thirds, enharmonics,
narrow-cut successions of chords<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>—these are the very
hand of Beethoven. The first movement works with its three
themes—an Olympian poem—as far as the <i lang="it">stretto</i>. Its development
rests on a fugal foundation. The scherzo is all rhythm;
in the trio, it is all unrhythmical; mystical colours, sliding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>passages from B flat minor to D flat major, as in the Ninth
Symphony from D minor to B flat major. The Adagio is
so to speak the last possibility of the old form, wide as life
itself, Michael Angelo-like in its strenuous longing for F sharp
major. The transitional passage, the Largo, which introduces the
last movement, like an old Toccata, tries this and that, prelude-wise,
and striving after fixed forms. The three-voiced giant-fugue
is the deliverance, in whose retardations the old storm, however,
still conceals itself. But there is a joy in the mighty straining
of these dissonances, which Bülow ought not to have tried to
soften. Theme and counter-theme, “cancrizans” canon,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> lyrical
episodes, dainty counter-motives, inversions, new canonic motives,
tied up again with the fugue, contrary motions, diminutions.
This old lofty tone speech remained serious; it is the refuge of
the anchorite who turns back to the powers of Nature, and finds
rest in the wise observation of the stars. It is the utmost of art
for art. Who is there whom it troubles?</p>

<p class="p2">Three flowers bloom in this late garden, three unique documents
of a pure masterdom: the “playing” sonata, the “landscape”
sonata, the “life” sonata. The first is on the heights of
pure technique, the second is a clarified objective picture, the third
is pure subjective inwardness.</p>

<p><abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 109 opens with a graceful impromptu-like harp-play of
broken chords, which twice thicken themselves in recitative songs.
A somewhat hard sounding scherzo stands in the midst. It is
closed by the variations on that never-to-be-forgotten melody in
E major, which, through reflective romance, cheerful étude-like
activity, sober fugues, bright trill-heights, lead back to the captivating
simplicity of their theme. The freedom of the first movement
and the confinement of the second are both made use of by
the third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
We have a landscape in the A flat major (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 110). Over
the sward rises the tender song. Butterflies and sun-glitter are
the accompaniment. A wholesome strength mounts up and cheerfully
wings its way. In a pause of meditation it comes to rest;
and from the contemplation rises the old eternal lamentation of
man. From its last breathed tones ascends the fugue, the great
law of nature. Once again the lament, broken, helpless, dashing
itself blindly against fate—and all the more dazzling is the fugue,
embracing all, Truth with its disregard of the individual.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Thus
does Beethoven express his pantheism.</p>

<p>But even this sonata seems feeble in comparison with the
unheard-of intensity and greatness of <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 111. The master sits
at the piano, and his hands run preluding over the keys, in broad,
piercing, dashing chords, which become closer and intenser round
the node-point of the dominant. From the dominant grows a
theme of savage grandeur, of Titanic power, all-embracing in its
widening grasp, its Medusa-locks flying in the air, crushing out all
sweetness and softness, till, as it came, it sinks terribly to earth, in
those helpless <i lang="it">diminuendo</i> chords,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> with no <i lang="it">ritardando</i>, such as
Beethoven alone experienced. In the elemental song of the
Adagio comes the release. In its variations it spreads itself out
into a world-embracing grandeur, till its wisdom attains the two
extremes of deep internal ardour and ethereal brightness, whose
opposition is developed in the last pages in broad lines. The
earth remains below; the minor conclusions are forgotten; the
forms have become a twilight dream; only when <em>our</em> soul meets
the Master-Soul does man attain to these realms.</p>

<p class="p2">At this time the inventive composer-publisher Diabelli had a
good idea. He composed a childish waltz in C major, and invited
fifty of the most distinguished composers and virtuosos of Vienna
and the Austrian states to be kind enough to set variations to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>Beethoven sent him thirty-three variations, which appeared as
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 120. Diabelli may well have been astonished. He had
perhaps some dread of the “last” Beethoven who was then so
full of youth. But he had not expected anything of this kind.
Perhaps he did not quite know whether it was all done in earnest.
Even the name of Beethoven did not aid the venture much. The
world during many years troubled itself little about it, and let the
strange colossus alone. It was reserved for Bülow, who had the
keenest sense for the last efforts of Beethoven’s genius, to penetrate
deeply into the great mass. He observed that the thirty-three
variations are no co-ordinated series; they are an inner drama,
like one of the later sonatas. They rise from the explanatory
sections which lay out the theme, through a gentle minor group, by
a double fugue, into calmer regions; a minuet concludes, which is
no minuet, but one of those wonderful resurrections which were
the old Master’s special love. The variations are a testament, as
the Goldberg variations were those of Bach. From melody to
canon, from gloom to parody, from archaism to anticipations of the
future, from popularity to the philosophy of the hermit, from mysticism
to dance, from technical glitter to the mystery of enharmonics,
they lead us along three and thirty paths to different realms.</p>

<h3>The Virtuosos</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s</span> playing was naturalistic. In him there were no
tricks of technique to be admired, no mere virtuosity to praise;
but the hearers were stirred to their hearts. In this storm and
stress, this whispering and listening, this awakening of the soul, they
recognised an original naturalism of piano-playing, standing by the
side of the naturalism of his creative art. Rhythm was the life
of his playing. He thought out all technique with a view to
rhythm. In the Berlin Library is a collection of Cramer’s Études,
containing a series of annotations by Schindler, the well-known
biographer of Beethoven. The expressions are so remarkable that
the spirit of Beethoven has not unjustly been detected in them.
Shedlock, in fact, has published them simply as Beethoven’s
elucidations of Cramer, whose Études the Master is known to have
prized exceedingly. In every Étude the <em>melos</em>, or latent melodic
air, which lies at the base of the figurations, is brought into
prominence, and the rhythmical presentation of these figurations
is made as accurate as possible. The rest is for the most part
left to the time, the diligence, and the ability of the player. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
could a great creator look at Études. Of necessity he looked
at them from a totally different point of view from the virtuoso
pure and simple. He cared chiefly for the presentation of the
idea, for the inwardness of the piece. Everything that was
written down in concrete notes served to him but as a means
for that expression, the mastery of which was the mastery of
interpretation. From this point of view Beethoven would have
written his “Klavierschule,” of which he often spoke in his latter
years. With mere fingering and wrist action he would have had
little indeed to do.</p>

<p>This great task was undertaken by a band of artists who must
not be undervalued. They stood in the first rank of virtuosos.
It is precisely at this time that technique first properly arises as
an art; and their zeal in the attempt to solve the new problem
was great indeed. They discover new possibilities of expression,
they disclose new effects in the capacities of the pianoforte, and
they reveal an inventive power in these new paths which offers
the most surprising beauties. We must consider them from the
right side, and never forget that the development of the piano
could never have taken place so naturally and organically unless
its technical advance had gone on in parallel lines with its
spiritual progress.</p>

<p>I have here no other aim than to view things under a certain
<i lang="la">species aeternitatis</i>. What was done by Bird, Bull, Couperin, or
Pasquini, though to-day perhaps only one in a thousand piano-players
knows their names, was of more importance than a Polacca
of Kalkbrenner or an Étude of Ludwig Berger. We have a fixed
horizon; what is not within it remains outside it. Lives of entire
and rich content, sorrows and joys of extreme intensity, may sink
into oblivion; they are in history a mere grain in the quicksand. It
is useless to look up in my index the name of everybody who has
composed a Rondo or given piano-lessons in Moscow. We must
content ourselves with those who, by the great halting-places,
have deserved a monument on the way: those only without
whom history would offer a distinct blank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
A very great work is represented by the theoretical piano-schools,
which followed one another at this time in close succession.
If in the little book of Philip Emanuel Bach there was
the beginning of a unifying system, on which the following age
had only to build, yet, in the face of the most varying theories of
the first half of our century, we can but recognise that piano-teaching,
from mere excess of zeal, never succeeded in developing
a genuine system. It has always been the tendency of the
piano-teacher to keep in the past an ideal to worship, while with
the present he has such a poor understanding that every new
method of instruction makes a <i lang="la">tabula rasa</i> of the preceding method,
begins all afresh, and allows the pupil salvation only according to
its private judgment. Piano-study has never enjoyed the advantage
possessed by other sciences, of building up from century to
century, each upon the last. In theory it has remained a mere
mosaic; and it has been saved only by practice.</p>

<p>It is practice also that gives a certain systematisation, not to
the teaching, but to the history of teaching. All the separate
workers at the great task, little as they admit the possibility of
salvation outside their own creed, are yet driven forward by the
stream of time and by the results of experience; and the law of
averages brings about a clear advance apart from their personal
agency. If we compare the systems of the eighteenth century,
the schools of Philip Emanuel, of Marpurg, and that of Daniel
Gottlob Türk, which closes this series, with the works of the epoch
on which we have now entered, we see clearly how practice has
marked out the path for theory, always reflecting upon itself,
itself inducing its decomposition into its constituent <i lang="fr">à priori</i> and
empirical parts, and finally limiting itself to a mere application of
experience.</p>

<p>The Pianoforte School which was written by Adam was a
kind of pronunciamento of the Paris Conservatoire. This Conservatoire,
founded in the midst of the troubles of the Revolution,
ultimately gave French technique a position to which for a long
time it had been a stranger. Adam’s principle is to put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
“manieren” more on one side, and to avoid that too eager
devotion to the teaching of general composition with which the
books of the eighteenth century had been occupied. In its place
he brings the study of touch more prominently forward. The day
of the spinet is over; the hammer-clavier now dominates the
world, and leads theorists to attempt methods of touch which
may correspond to its possibilities of delicate expression. The
pedals also begin to play their part. Adam recognises four
pedals, of which one is our damper-raiser, and three serve for soft
effects. Gradually they have been reduced to two, the damper-raiser
and the so-called “soft” pedal.</p>

<p class="p2">A great opponent of all use of the pedal was Hummel. In
our time it is no longer necessary to point out that the pedal, an
integral part of the hammer-clavier, deserves not to be rejected,
but simply to be treated on its own artistic lines. But Hummel
stands, in his theoretic relations, so strongly on the foundations of
tradition, that his attitude can excite no surprise. His “Ausführliche
theoretisch-praktische Anweisung zum Pianofortespiel,” which
appeared in 1828, is the crown of the united exertions of piano
theory. This voluminous work, which gained with difficulty a
circulation that it soon lost for ever, is a system, carried out into
the minutest details, of all the technical capacities of the piano;
so systematic, indeed, that here theory, by deductive methods,
discovered effects which practice could not have attained alone.
It is an unparalleled example of theoretic speculation, and yet
really nothing more than the extension of Marpurg’s or Türk’s
old-fashioned methods. These countless headings in capital
letters, each describing a different class of “passage,” these
numbered possibilities of fingering, these pedantic elucidations,
beginning always from the first over again, are nothing but, as
he calls them, an “Anweisung,” mere directions, abstraction from
reflection outward. Any one who has mastered the first part has
the second already at his fingers’ ends, but this master of dissection
troubles himself not a whit on that point, and knows no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
economy in pupilage. He is opposed to learning by heart, since
the fingers, he says, ought to find the keys without sight: so far is
he from the modern view that only a complete mastery of a piece
renders adequate interpretation possible. He troubles himself
little about a science of touch. He introduces the “manieren”;
but, contrary to the method of the eighteenth century, he makes
the trill begin on the upper note. So far is a system of execution
from his purpose that he can actually write as follows: “Runs
and notes going upwards are executed crescendo, downwards
diminuendo; but there are cases in which the composer intends
the reverse, or that they should be played with even strength.”
Hummel’s book is to-day a monument of misguided diligence,
great in its patient calculation of permutations, but a dead
curiosity.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we look at Kalkbrenner’s Paris Pianoforte
School, which he dedicated “to all the conservatoriums in
Europe,” we see—with no heavy artillery—advances of all kinds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
which in part fill up the perspective of Adam. Where Hummel
has ten main classes of fingered passages, he has only six; five-finger
exercises for the unmoving hand; scales in all forms;
thirds, sixths, and chord-forms; octaves with the wrist; trills; overlapping
of the hands. In this there is more thrift, while there is
no talk of absolute completeness. The “manieren” slowly cease
to occupy important chapters; the pedals again come by their
own; for Kalkbrenner as a Parisian hates the dry tone of the
Vienna pianoforte. Execution also begins to receive a systematic
treatment. Interesting references are made to punctuation in
order to illustrate musical phraseology; conclusions on the tonic
are a full stop; on the dominant a semicolon; while interrupted
cadences are a note of exclamation. This is naive enough, but it
is at any rate a beginning.</p>

<p>We are thus already standing at the point at which clavier
theory decomposes itself into its elements. If Hummel was the
great theoretician, Czerny was the great man of practice; a quite
unique person, the hero of all piano-teachers, whose practical eye
runs equally over all the possibilities of playing, and works them
out in separate parts; the genius of the Étude. He it was who
discovered the great secret that no separation of methods of
fingering is of any avail in practice, but that the perfection of
the fingers must be carried out solely on the basis of their
mechanical gymnastic. It is useless to try to apply my five
fingers to so many theoretically possible permutations; the important
question is what practical use can be made of my fingers
according to their physical structure. Czerny has no obsolete
rules of practice, but a science of mechanism; thus taking the
very opposite pole to Hummel. Piano-study, which with Couperin
and Philip Emanuel was still a part of a musical training with just
the necessary amount of mechanics, became with him primarily
the gymnastic of the fingers with the addition of instruction in
touch and execution. Long past are the times when the good old
clavier was only used to “fill” the song, which was after all the
essence of music. From music we have come to the fingers. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
science of the fingers is constructed, and the fingers are trained
as earlier only the throat was trained. Technique has remembered
her own ways, and made the last first. The emancipation of
finger-gymnastic was an epoch-marking point in the treatment
of the piano, the desired answer of theory to practice, which for a
long time had recognised the specific art of the piano. It was
perhaps the last important stride in its emancipation when the
results of practice were made the groundwork of instruction.
Czerny, in his great Pianoforte School, his Opus 500, is almost
entirely free from the <i lang="fr">à priori</i> theory. He transfers mechanics
to music. With good results he treats individual cases, as for
example, when he appends to the beginning of passages a finger-exercise
not given in the scale; he designs immediately to return
to the usual fingering in order to arrive duly at the extreme notes
with the extreme fingers, and to avoid unnecessary underpassing.
It was reserved for a later time not merely to bring the note-material
lying before us into harmony with economic fingering,
but also to make execution, which with Czerny has but a loose
dependence on the finger-exercise, re-act upon the fingers. Bülow,
for example, is fond of unusual fingering, in which the execution
forbids any too easy playing, and a too loose rendering is prevented
by irregularities in the succession of the fingers.</p>

<p class="p2">The mechanics of the fingers formed the first part of piano-instruction;
touch and execution were the second. Their importance
as means to the mechanism of music was fully seen; and in
the “Technical Studies” of Plaidy, or in Köhler’s “Methode für
Klavierspiel und Musik” (1857), they are as exhaustively handled
as before had been the “manieren” or the thorough-bass. The
former contents himself with the simple terms, Legato, Staccato,
Legatissimo, and Portamento; the latter gives a more mechanical
division, always according to the use of the fore-arm, the finger-joints,
the wrist, or the elbow. Neither is complete, neither supplies
a systematic advance on the lines of his predecessors; and
we should be astonished at these divergences if we set the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
numerous schools of these times, from a theoretical point of
view, over against one another. Practically considered, however,
they agree well enough. The holding of the hand as enjoined by
Philip Emanuel Bach has remained on the whole unaltered down
to the present day. With trifling differences, which concern the
relation of the extreme fingers to the middle finger, and the profile
of the back of the hand, Bach, Türk, Müller, Hummel, Logier,
Kalkbrenner and the rest, are at one as to the support of the arm
which carries the hand, and of the hand which carries the fingers
as they descend. In Paris Logier constructed an instrument to
hold the hand in practice, in shape like a bracket, which he named
“chiroplast.” Kalkbrenner, in his “Guide-mains,” introduced
some modifications on the chiroplast; but such mechanical contrivances
gained no general acceptance. Logier’s speciality was
his prefatory note that the finger must remain in continual touch
with the key. With this was allied that special kind of sensuously
charming touch which differentiated the Parisian school from the
brilliant playing of the Viennese and the emotional style of the
English. That <i lang="it">carezzando</i>, or stroking of the keys, was a favourite
practice of Kalkbrenner and Kontski in Paris. To-day Risler
remains perhaps alone in this school with his pure sensuous charm
of touch.</p>

<p>If, in the whole great group of technical artists, which is
bounded on the one side by Wölffl, Wanhal, Kozeluch, Eberl, in
Mozart’s generation, and on the other by Thalberg and Liszt in
ours, we should look for truly pre-eminent spirits, then we should
have remaining Clementi, the father of all technique; Hummel,
the inventor of the modern piano-exercise; and Czerny, the genius
of teaching. But if we ask for the lines of the motion which runs
through this epoch, we observe the victory of a virtuoso impulse,
which goes back to Hummel, over a plainer and more intellectual
tendency which has its rise in Clementi. The school of Clementi
prefers the English pianoforte with its heavier but richer touch;
that of Hummel the Viennese, with its lighter tone, which lends
itself more easily to effects.</p>

</div><!--end figright-->

<p>But it is not possible to
draw a sharp line between the
two groups. A Moscheles
serves not less the spirit of
Clementi than that of Hummel.
The simplicity of Cramer,
the counterpoint of Klengel,
the plainness of Ludwig Berger,
the intensity of Field, belong
to the circle of Clementi’s influence.
Berger’s pupils, Greulich,
Heinrich Dorn, Wilhelm
Taubert, Albert Löschhorn,
whose studies still live, carry this style down to our own time.
The teaching of Hummel lived on in Ferdinand Hiller, Benedict,
Wilmers, Baake, Ernst Pauer, the Viennese Pixis. While Beethoven
left behind him as actual pupils only the Archduke Rudolf
and Ferdinand Ries, a respectable imitator, his temporary pupil
Czerny passed over into the wake of Hummel, and brought the
Viennese style to a final victory. Kalkbrenner, Moscheles, Weber,
Liszt, Thalberg, Döhler, Madame Oury, Madame Pleyel, Theodore
Kullak, Pollini, of whom many belong externally to Clementi’s
school, passed as apostles of Viennese technique to all lands from
St Petersburg to London, from Paris to Milan.</p>

<p>Certain traditions of musical coteries and centres of instruction
exhibit with this international character some more or less
important local groups. In Prague men adored Tomaschek, the
composer of Eclogues and Rhapsodies; Dionysius Weber, the first
director of a Conservatorium there; and his successor Kittl.
From Tomaschek’s school proceeded Alexander Dreyschock, the
specialist of the left hand; Ignaz Tedesco, the “Hannibal of
octaves”; and Schulhoff, the fashionable composer. In the middle
of the century the Prague tradition was upheld by Proksch.</p>

<p>In Frankfort lived Vollweiler, who enjoyed a widespread
renown as a teacher, and later went to St Petersburg; and Aloys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
Schmitt, whose delicate Études have been taken up by Bülow into
his great collection of educational pieces.</p>

<p>Vienna alternates, but never loses in wealth. Berlin and
St Petersburg as yet produced no fixed or permanent school.
Leipzig takes its colour from the foundation of the Conservatorium
with Mendelssohn and Moscheles and their fellow-citizen Schumann.
England, from Clementi to Moscheles, imported a constant succession
of Continental artists. The influence of the Conservatorium
runs far and wide. A Strassburger named Hüllmandel, who took
up his abode in Paris in 1776, had started clavier-instruction there.
His pupil Jadin was director of the piano at the new Conservatoire.
For forty-six years after 1797, Adam, whose name we remember
because of his improved piano-school, carried on his labours in
Paris. He was a tasteful professor, and brought the Parisian
renown to its height. Kalkbrenner, the acrobat, succeeded him.
Adam’s colleague, Pradher, was the teacher of those worst
of fashionable composers, Herz, Hünten, Rosellen, shallowest
and emptiest of musicians. Within the same walls was a
Chopin!</p>

<p>The life of the great virtuosos is a reflection of the unrest
inseparable from their calling. It is indeed no longer a life of
adventure, as with Marchand and Froberger; there is method
in the madness. The life of the executant, no less than the
execution, has found its form. The concert-campaigns are the
foundation; the warrior returns to his home at greater and greater
intervals; until at last, when delight in recitals has waned along
with the pliancy of the fingers, some resting-place or other is
found—a share in a piano-manufactory or a steady round of
instruction. During the campaigns instruction also takes a kind
of locomotive form; devoted pupils follow the master, and leave
him at fitting places, to pitch their tents there and make room for
other peregrinating pupils. Or, on the other hand, pupils swarm
from all parts of the earth to a place which the Master is always
leaving, but to which he constantly returns—like the summer
students of German universities—a type of professional existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
of which Liszt’s Weimar period
gives perhaps the most famous
exemplification.</p>

<p>Muzio Clementi (1752-1832)
was the first to exhibit this form
of virtuoso-life on the great scale.
Born in Italy, he found a home in
London through the support of a
wealthy Englishman; but he was
far from showing the sedentary
character of a Bach, a Couperin,
or a Beethoven. Virtuosity impels to travel, as composition
keeps a man at home. The difference which we observed
between the sensitive anchorite Bach and the cosmopolitan
popularity-hunter Handel, appears again between Beethoven and
these executants. Mozart was too many-sided, and besides he
died too young, to become a universal teacher of the piano; but
Clementi lived almost three generations, during which half Europe
grouped itself round him and his pupils. Down to 1780 he was
still “cembalist” at the London Italian opera; during the next
ten years he undertook two great tours, one to Vienna, the other
to Paris. Meanwhile he became partner in an English piano-firm,
which failed, whereupon he founded one of his own along with
Collard. He set out for St Petersburg with his pupil Field; left
him there; but on the way gained two new pupils, Berger and
Klengel, whom also he established in St Petersburg. On one
of his tours at Berlin he married, only to lose his wife shortly
after. In 1810 he made another circular tour through Vienna and
Italy. He spent another whole winter in Leipzig, and married a
second time. His last years, when the world had outgrown him,
he spent quietly in London.</p>

<p>In the life of Hummel (1778-1837), the favourite pupil of
Mozart, posts as kapellmeister with Esterhazy, in Stuttgart and
in Weimar, with a longer, unattached residence at Vienna,
regulated the varying domiciles at which he lived. Weimar, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
great resting place, enjoyed through him its first musical renown,
which reached half through the period of Goethe. In the intervals
he took his concert-tours to Dresden, Paris, Holland, Berlin,
Belgium, England, Scotland, and St Petersburg. These, as far
as the furloughs of a kapellmeister permitted, recurred with a
certain regularity, till they gradually ceased entirely.</p>

<p>Cramer (1771-1858) had two long stays in London, in the
midst of which a sojourn at Paris occupied the years from 1832 to
1845. He found a secondary occupation in a London musical
house, in which he was a partner from 1828 to 1842. Kalkbrenner
(1784-1849), on the contrary, lived in Paris, but his
residence there was interrupted by a nine years’ stay in London
(1814-1823). He too had secondary interests. He was concerned
with Logier in a company for the exploitation of the “Chiroplast,”
and he had also a share in a piano-factory. Moscheles (1794-1870)
had no business. His external life was made up of his youthful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
time in Vienna with Beethoven and Meyerbeer, his sensational
Parisian recitals of 1820, his glorious stay in London from 1821
to 1846, and his professoriate at the Leipzig Conservatorium. At
intervals, of course, he made Continental concert-tours.</p>

<p>Among all the great virtuosos and teachers only Czerny had
a really fixed abode (1791-1857). As a boy of fifteen he was
already a teacher in Vienna, and as such he died there; his tours
also being few and far between.</p>

<p>But Czerny is in this respect an exception. Otherwise the
international play of virtuosity led to an exchange and co-operation,
to the mutual curiosity and desire to learn, which mark the
concert-life of that age. Duet-playing by great executants, in
private or in the concert-hall, is nothing unusual throughout this
time. But the genuine interpreter does not as yet exist. The
player has mostly a personal interest in the piece performed, and
the friends assist at the christening. It is the time of the Hexameron.
Exchange is often even too self-abnegatory. Moscheles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
composed for Cramer (with whom, as also with Ries and Kalkbrenner,
he often played duets) a last movement for Cramer’s own
sonata for two pianofortes. Later on he took the piece back again
and tacked it on to his well-known piece, “Hommage à Haendel!”
We need not then be surprised at such gruesome pasticcios
as the programme of a London Philharmonic concert under
Weber,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> when were played the C sharp minor concerto of Ries,
the E flat major of Beethoven, and the Hungarian Rondo of
Pixis.</p>

<p>The two volumes of “Recollections of the life of Moscheles,”
which his wife compiled from diaries and letters, give a clear view
of the rich international concert-life of this age. Year by year we
follow the kaleidoscopic existence of these artists, who see each
other constantly and constantly part. Triumphs of virtuosity fill
the winter seasons, followed by recreation in the country and preparations
for an enlarged repertoire. The halls echo with jubilation
and applause; and the audiences, especially the easily-kindled
Viennese, are enthusiastic in their cheers. Music has become so
popular and the compositions are so extraordinarily banal that it
certainly did not often occur that they were rejected for shallowness—although,
on the other hand, Kalkbrenner’s experience with
a Beethoven symphony at a Paris Conservatoire concert was a sad
warning to those who try to improve the public taste. The dilettantes
push forward the more, the circle of instruction widens the
cheaper and better the pianos become. They push themselves
into rivalry with the artists in great concerts; as Moscheles relates
of the celloist Sir William Curtis and the pianists Oom and Mrs
Fleming. “I have to hear so much insipid music.” “Musique
mise à la portée de tout le monde.” From professional piano-playing—and
they often played at two places in an evening—the
artists took recreation with the good temper which never failed
in those years. The great singer Malibran would sit down to the
piano and sing the Rataplan and the Spanish songs, to which
she would imitate the guitar on the keyboard. Then she would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>imitate famous colleagues, and a Duchess greeting her, and a Lady
So-and-so singing “Home Sweet Home” with the most cracked
and nasal voice in the world. Thalberg would then take his seat
and play Viennese songs and waltzes with “obligato snaps.”
Moscheles himself would play with hand turned round, or with
the fist; perhaps under the fist disguising the thumb, which in
Moscheles’ peculiar way of playing used to take the thirds under
the palm of the hand.</p>

<p>These players preferred to play their own compositions. The
separation between composer and virtuoso was not yet complete.
Of course, when Ferdinand Hiller in his “Life of an Artist” says
that he had never heard either Hummel or Chopin, Thalberg or
Moscheles, play a piece by another composer, his experience was
at least unique. Moscheles, for example, even played Scarlatti on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
the old harpsichord. But, as a rule, they abode by the old custom,
so far at least as amateurs were not concerned. These latter were
in their instruction-books liberally provided with historical
material.</p>

<p>Improvisation also flourished in concerts and soirées; and
playing and composing, which in improvisation form a true union,
can only with difficulty be severed in an age of creative virtuosos.
Kalkbrenner composed while playing, and played while composing,
so that no one could tell the difference between the two; and
Czerny used to invent the necessary étude in the midst of the
lesson. Thus it happened—a state of things unparalleled to-day—that
the beloved duet-playing could be combined with the
equally beloved improvisation—mutually contradictory as they
appear. Moscheles speaks of an improvised duet with Mendelssohn.
The latter played in the bass some English songs in
ballad-style; the former interwove in the treble the scherzo of
his friend’s A minor symphony.</p>

<p>Slight as was the advance yet made in division of labour
between player and composer, there was equally little comprehensive
division between the species of music. We do not hear of
chamber-music evenings, pianoforte evenings, orchestral concerts.
All was mingled in one; and chamber-music finds the same
audience as the symphony. A piano-recital without orchestra
was a rarity; and the concerto-form is almost <i lang="fr">de règle</i> in all the
greater performances. This is seen in the compositions of this
period, which, as a rule, so far as they are specially adapted to
public performance, were written for orchestral accompaniment.
By their side were editions for private use, including the important
orchestral portions. This concerto-piece could not greatly or permanently
aid in the advance of a delicate or intimate piano-music.
Through the rarity of special piano recitals it was not so easy to
get pianos when they were wanted. In Frankfort there lived a
well-known old lady who had absolutely the only piano store in
the city. People had to praise her playing, to blow the trumpet
of advertisement for her wares (they were Streicher’s), to court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
her and cringe to her in order to get an instrument for a
concert.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In 1837 Moscheles ventured to introduce piano-evenings without
orchestra. This was an important step. But even yet the
evening was not wholly devoted to the piano. A soprano or
contralto filled the gap between one performance and the next.
How long was it before the serious nature of a concert was universally
acknowledged! Possibly here the production of dubious
works of the performer’s own led to a low, acrobatic conception of
the true state of affairs; and it was only the interpretation of good
works by others, which were more serious, that saved taste from
complete degeneration. The public gradually became quiet, and
felt itself turned from educator into educated. The court ceases
to take its supper during the playing;<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the cantatrice no longer
concludes her <i lang="fr">roulades</i> with a smile worthy of the circus; and a
singer is no longer hissed off the stage if he forgets to give his
hand by way of thanks to his fair partner. Slowly it is realised
that the concert is not a place for showing off, nor a mere form of
social amusement, but a religious service.</p>

<p>This composite structure of virtuosity carried to the extent of
vapidity, and of interpretation carried into historical research, is
reflected in the compositions of the period. On the one side the
tradition was exactly carried on; people began to view the existing
classical works—Mozart’s and Beethoven’s Sonatas, or all
kinds of pieces by Scarlatti, Bach, and Handel, as material for
study; they republished half-forgotten or badly edited authors
like Scarlatti; they even wrote sonatas “in the style of Scarlatti”;
they arranged for the piano great quantities of the most
various chamber or orchestral music. Alongside of the historical
tendency stands, as so often, the international. Spanish, Irish,
Russian, Italian, Polish national airs and rhythms are taken <i lang="fr">en</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
<i lang="fr">masse</i> into the circle of salon music; the air swarms with Polonaises,
Boleros, Gipsy airs, Ecossaises, Tarantelles. But this quite
cosmopolitan music was stamped by a <em>fade</em> enthusiasm for beauty;
and there is bound up with the pieces an empty sentimental greeting
or a hypocritical reminiscence. The mythological titles of the
seventeenth century, and the realistic ones of the eighteenth, yield
to the sentimental ones<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> of the bourgeois empire. But never was
this system of naming pieces on a lower level; and never did it
so corrupt the taste of the believing multitude. Even to-day we
are not yet freed from its traces. Then there are the “Hommages
à Beethoven” or “à Händel” corresponding to the old “Tombeaux,”
but with less sincerity of intention. Then there are the
“Fire pieces”—a whole collection of dedications to fire brigades—the
“Burning of Mariazell,” and the “Ruins of Wien Neustadt,”
figure among the salon-music of Czerny. Then follow the geographical
recollections—the innumerable souvenirs of all possible
towns, rivers, mountains, and people, such as the “Souvenir de
mon premier voyage,” “les Charmes de Paris,” “le Retour à
Londres,” etc. By their side are genuine characteristic titles
chiefly employed to gild the pill of the “study.” Most objectionable
of all are the favourite opera-fantasias, which are specially in
vogue in the Parisian school. These tear the airs almost from the
very mouths of the singers, and the composer’s completed melodies
from his work, and stuff the <i lang="fr">pot pourri</i> with passages, figurations,
and fragments of études, with spurious slow introductions and
sentimental passages, so that finally absolutely nothing of the
essence of the original airs is left. These are perhaps the worst
examples of want of style and taste to be found in the history of
art. Here the curse of popularity came home to roost; here was
reached the extreme point, in the publicity of the concert and of
society, which the clavier had to pass through since the development
of the hammer-mechanism. Any harshness in an artistic
work was sufficient to condemn it; invention was tabooed; smoothness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>and the tickling of the ear were the only law. What in Paris
was done by Herz, Hünten, Karr, Rosellen, Kontski, and their
fellows, made a great sensation, and quickly vanished. Hünten
received for a moderate-sized work from fifteen hundred to two
thousand francs; to-day he is banished even from the salon. Karr
wrote to order hundreds of pieces; to-day no amateur knows a
single one out of the huge mass. And the days in which Kontski’s
“Reveil du lion” was put in the hands of pupils appear to be
past for ever.</p>

<p>The interdependence of piano and opera was not merely
external. In Paris the opera, with its world-ruling influence, not
merely forms a musical centre to which everything gravitates; it
is itself subjected to the great law of this period—the law of
mosaic work and of the aim to please. In the thirties and forties
the world had thus reached hollow ostentation in the grand opera,
and in the comic opera mere ballet-dancing. “Where,” wrote
Wagner at that time, “where has the grace of Méhul, of Isouard,
of Boieldieu, and of the young Auber gone, chased out of sight by
the abject quadrille rhythms, which to-day rattle through the
theatre of the opera comique and keep everything else out?”
What was seen there was like what was heard on the pianoforte—pointless
situations, introduced for the sake of the “business,”
tirades which seem to be closed with the smile of the acrobat when
he has finished his trick—technique, and nothing but technique.
A librettist like Scribe is loaded with commissions, surrounded by
Parisian or foreign composers—even Wagner in his youth having
once written to him. He understands how to manufacture the
proper substratum for the musical triflings. Read from this point
of view Auber’s later operas, as the “La Part du Diable,” or those
overtures whose whole structure depends on the fact that they are
skilfully adapted to dances; or that daub-work in the musical
setting with the jaundiced transition passages, where a proper
modulation would be almost out of place; or those boleros, which
people sing in circumstances of the utmost grief, without being able
to raise themselves to the height of the irony; or those étude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
colourations, introduced in the most indifferent places provided
they pay, and developing themselves vigorously about a single
vowel; or those scores, which are so miserably transparent that one
can see the author first rapidly composing them at the piano and
then putting in the instrumentation slap-dash. It is the first, and
let us hope, the last time, that the piano reaches its hand to the
opera—a most unfruitful elective affinity. Opera and piano are
necessarily and essentially hostile. In the Paris of that day, when
absolute music, as well that of Berlioz as that of Chopin, is still a
modest retiring flower, the crowd ran after the gentle titillation of
the opera, and the mass of piano music moves in the operatic
humdrum path. Among the Parisians as among the Italians there
was assuredly not an operatic composer who did not invent at the
piano and transfer his inventions from the piano to the opera.
Donizetti has left an interesting letter to his brother-in-law
Vesselli, which was fastened as an inscription on his piano: “Do
not sell this piano at any price, for it contains my whole artistic
life from 1822 onwards. Its tone lingers in my ears. In it
murmur Anna, Maria, Fausta, Lucia. Let it live as long as I
live! I lived with it my years of hope, of wedded happiness, of
loneliness. It heard my cries of joy, it saw my tears, my disenchantments,
my honours. It shared with me my toils and the
sweat of my brow. In it dwells my genius, every section of my
path. It saw your father, your brother, all of us; we all have
tortured it; it was a true comrade to us all, and may it always be
a comrade to your daughter as a dowry of a thousand sad and
happy thoughts.”</p>

<p>There seems so much that is contemptible in this technical
school that it would almost appear, at least from the artistic point
of view, to have lived in vain. And yet it was at this time
that a form sprang into existence which, born from technical
necessities, became a custom, and from a custom a style, and so
emphatically a style that it was able to enter into effective rivalry
with the older styles—the contrapuntal, the thematic, the <i lang="fr">leit-motif</i>.
We are still under its dominion. This form is the <i lang="fr">Étude</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
The Étude was not the invention of the technists. It existed
in germ in Bach; it half grew out of thematic; only the visual
angle altered with time. In an invention or symphony of Bach
a motive is treated according to the free laws of imitation; it is
used up in all the voices, for all fingers. In a Prelude on some
thematic ground-subject, in a fugue with its stern code of canonic
succession, the same is the case: the motive is expended on itself.
But between the broken chords of Bach’s C sharp Prelude and
those of Chopin’s C sharp Étude there is a vast difference in the
treatment. What in the one is used with a view to the motive is
here expended with a view to the technique. Bach sets before
him the artistic possibilities of the theme: Chopin the mechanical.
Bach wrote many of his preludes with educational purposes;
but he did not compose them with a sole view to their full practical
value. As in theory the musical and the mechanical cannot be
sharply severed, so the pieces are half for the purpose of supplying
music, half means of instruction. The mechanical part was
obliged first to emancipate itself before the conception of the
Étude could be fully grasped. On the straight line leading from
the old thematic to the Étude style, the conception of the motive
altered itself. Motives were now found which could be arranged
according to their technical productiveness. We see perhaps
even the same motive, considered first contrapuntally or as a
fixed idea, but afterwards according to its mechanical value.</p>

<p>There are motives whose interest lies in the size of the hand;
or in the playing of a legato passage simultaneously with the chords
in the same hand;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> or again, contrary motion of chords in both
hands has to be carried out; or, yet further, attention is paid to an
easy gliding of the hand over great stretches; or finger-changing on
the same key is the ground-idea. The piece may aim at <i lang="it">cantabile</i>
or at the perfect legato in a <i lang="it">fugato</i> movement, or at the practice
of octaves, pearl-like scales, pianissimo touch, the freedom of the
left hand, a double melody, or any of the hundred technical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>possibilities. There are dry and insipid methods of thus working
out academically a technical idea; but it is also possible to see in
delicate and ingenious ways, slumbering germs of great fruitfulness
in the technical motive, and to develop powers of unexpected
beauty. The one way sees in a broken chord only the means of
using it in major or minor modes, or in the seventh, or in some
unusual successions, first for the right hand, then for the left, then
for both, and perhaps finally with sustained notes. Theory is
satisfied, a practical object provided, the academic conscience
laid to rest. But the other way sees in the broken chords their
elementary character, the germ of the Rheingold or of the
Götterdämmerung. It permits them first to sound slightly,
then to grow further and further, to assume a daemonic grandeur;
like eternal signs, to stretch over the heavens and embrace the
worlds. Thus, no less than the other, it presents all the <i lang="fr">nuances</i>
of major, minor, seventh, right, left, up and down; but it covers
these technical variations so perfectly with the sense of the inner
meaning that they become identified, and can never be separated:
the technical and the characteristic content have, in the mind of
a genius like this, involuntarily become a unity. Such a master,
for example, takes the neat finger-changing on one note as the
means for a rococo-sketch, the pianissimo leaps for a dance of the
elves, the rolling passages in the left hand for the roar of the sea
with elemental upper parts; the rhythmical varieties in left
and right for graceful fetters of the dance; the scurrying glide
over the black keys for a picture of homely pleasures. Here
reveals itself the entire fruitfulness of the technical setting, which—who
could believe it?—precisely by the limitation of the motive,
approaches very near to characteristic art and realism of presentation.
Here is a rich field opened to technical subjectivity.
Personality is very variously displayed in the setting of a technical
idea. Contrast with Clementi, who scarcely ever shows any
specific sense of character in a motive, such a man as Hummel,
who on theoretic grounds calculates out the utmost technical
possibilities of a motive; or Czerny, who in a practical manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
attains the same many-sidedness; or Cramer, who was the first
to find his way back to music from technique; or Moscheles,
Chopin, Schumann, who cannot think technique without feeling
character.</p>

<p>Deep and mysterious is this connection between the Étude and
its musical setting. Like the fugue the simplest Étude goes back to
those elemental foundations which cannot fail of their impression,
even if practically nothing is composed upon them. I hear some
simple scale-étude of Bertini played, with the smooth harmonies
on which it is built. There is nothing in the piece, no soul reveals
itself to me, and yet there is a weird charm in these eternal ground-motives
of all music, and in their tonics and dominants which are
so to speak anchored in eternity. The dull man is soon wearied
by them, but the sensitive man instantly responds. At this point
the Étude sinks down to the great mother of all music: like the
fugue it springs directly out of Nature. With the consciousness
of character the Étude grows tuneful. In the studies of Moscheles,
in the Symphonic Études of Schumann, in Chopin’s studies, art
creates what Nature created. From the technical theme rises a
certain spiritual aroma, reminding us of a tune, a scene, a landscape;
the tune condenses itself in the return of the technical
motive; it collects itself all the more narrowly and closely, in proportion
as all contrasts and secondary tunes keep their distance.
It is a spiritual melody, set in a firm frame, as condensed as neither
the free fantasia form, nor the thematic sonata, nor the canonic
fugue, had ever presented it. The tune is so concentrated that it
cannot dispense with the frame, or it would fly to pieces. It has
no capacity of transference; it prefers to exist as a fragment
ready-made.</p>

<p>It is thus that the Étude fixes the form. It favours fixed and
limited technical models, which fit mosaic-wise into each other. It
is opposed to huge, Beethoven-like emotions and their expression;
its horizon does not pass beyond two pages. It is still further
removed from Bach’s method, which depended on plain thematic
development; it loves the speedy and the limited, and confines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
itself entirely to the practical. It penetrates into all works in
which technical brilliance gives a false impression of the contents,
or in which the greatness of the contents only finds its last expression
by technique.</p>

<p>The technical setting of the form, and the technical expression,
pass over entirely into the consciousness of the time, and create
new works in chamber-music, opera, and orchestra.</p>

<p>Compare the development of a sonata by Weber with that of
one by Beethoven; for example, Weber’s fourth in E minor with
Beethoven’s <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 28—two sonatas which in original idea, a soft
melodic tune, were not so unlike as they turned out to be. In
Beethoven the first melody develops itself on a 3/4 rhythm, which
begins and ends naturally; the second theme is an unforced contrast
to the first; gradually figurations attach themselves, which
are natural offshoots of them, intertwining themselves without losing
their original dependence; all grows logically out of itself; the
end is given in the beginning, and the progress in the variation.
In Weber, on the contrary, each piece is carried through by itself:
the whole is no organism but a mere pasticcio. The sensitive first
subject is treated in its naked melodic beauty; a semiquaver passage
is attached to it; a bald enharmonic study leads on to the
second theme, which treats its soothing character from many sides;
and only the “free” section brings the whole a little closer
together. And we know how even in the best men of this period
the great creative organism, in which every part conditions its own
subordinate part, gives place to a mere isolation and to total want
of system. In the concertos, after the traditional mutual compliments
of orchestra and piano, the solo instrument starts, with
surprising suddenness, on its passages, which are strung together
from étude-pieces, selected haphazard. At the conventional places
the curtain is withdrawn, and the whole glitter of technique is
displayed. The harsh transitions, the quick returns, the jostling
fugues, are not only a peculiarity, say, of Schumann—they are the
style of the time. They are the <em>framing</em> style of a time which does
not care for the want of restraint that attends great emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Its preference is for constructive logic in detail. More genuine
piano music than the Étude there cannot be. The essence of the
piano has in it become music. Matter and aim here alone determine
the form, which no longer speaks merely in a universal
musical language.</p>

<p>The piano follows the lines of the time, which pursues technical
purity in all things. In the representative arts certain styles
were long seen to predominate, which for limited periods were
indifferently transferred to all objects without respect to matter or
aim. Renaissance, Gothic, antique, exhibit their churches, their
tombs, their doors, their tables, their cupboards, their keys,
whether they are bosses or reliefs, marbles or bronzes. In our
century technique begins to speak its first word: a chair is to be
a chair; a carpet shall be constructed with a view to the aim of
carpets; a vase must speak in accordance with the material of
vases; and painting must in the first instance be painting. A
cupboard is not an entrance to a temple; a table leg not a statue.
These are intrusions which art has not often experienced in its
history. With music the case was not dissimilar. The fugal
style ruled once so mightily that it drew church, dance, salon,
fantasia, tune, all indifferently, under its sway. The good fugue
was a good tune, and the best tune could only be expressed in
contrapuntal form. Now, however, the emancipation had taken
place. The organ no longer worked necessarily along with the
piano, nor the song with the violin; and the orchestra became
conscious of its power as a totality. What the Venetians had once
timidly begun was now carried into actual fact; and the artistic
form of the étude was the seal of this individualising process.
The much-praised Paganini had no longer, like Corelli, to prompt
the piano, as far as its content was concerned, from the violin
outwardly. Paganini-études, by Schumann, were strict piano-pieces,
which as far as form went borrowed nothing from Paganini,
and in matter only a groundwork of notes. They strive towards
the brilliancy of Paganini’s execution—that astonishing, spiritual
technique, which aroused so wonderfully the emulation of a Liszt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
And in turn there passed from the
piano the brilliancy of a technique
which inspired the orchestra to its
own special triumphs. The “Queen
Mab,” the “Mephistopheles,” the
“Feuer-Zauber,” and the “Valkyries’
Ride” did not need to envy the piano.
Yet without the fame of the Étude
they would never have been so brilliant.</p>

</div><!--end figleft-->

<p>We are now coming nearer the
personalities themselves. It is no
long stride from the virtuosos to the
romantic writers; the latter are only
to be explained by reference to the former. We pass slowly
from the domain of pure virtuosity to that of compositions
of deeper meaning; from the realm of the teacher to that of
the poet; from piano purism to the longing after poetic interdependence;
from the noise of concerts to the intimate retirement
of the home.</p>

<p>In Clementi these signs appeared first. What he had to say
was little; but what he had to teach was only the more in
consequence. He collected, he tested, he drew out his experiences,
and never willingly abandoned the historical attitude.
This was the first recoil on the classical period. Clementi’s
Studies were so fruitful that even a Beethoven was not unmoved
by them; although of course there were many who opposed
themselves to his speciality, the passages in thirds and sixths for
one hand. Mozart hated this unrest; he aimed at a graceful and
easy style. But the growth of technique soon shook off this old-fashioned
rococo method; it aimed at universal conquest.</p>

<p>As Clementi still lives in what we may call his “<em>grand-pupils</em>,”
so his Gradus ad Parnassum has remained the father of all Étude-works,
often reprinted, often re-edited. It is easy to recognise in
it its antiquated constituent parts. No principle of distinction is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
adopted between the fingering of diatonic and chromatic scales.
In his directions Clementi begins his chromatics with <em>E</em>. The
Études move in a peculiar middle region between compositions
and exercises. Single Études, like the splendid Presto
in F sharp minor, reach the heights of a Cramer (Simrock, 24).
He even provides genuine fugues in order that the fugal style
may also be practised. In one Étude (Simrock, 38) cantabile and
triplets are mingled as exercises. Often again three pieces appear
together as a suite—a patriarchal retention of old customs.
Others again are mere dry and insipid instruction-exercises.
We follow with pleasure the process by which fixed technical
problems gained in content as time went on. For example, the
change of finger on one key is in Clementi a mere tedious motive
with three notes only (Simrock, 20). In Cramer (Pauer, 41 ff) is
already perceived the charm which short held notes may introduce
into this monotonous exercise; and the drollery which a change of
fingers as the characteristic motive carries concealed in itself,
gives the character to the piece. Chopin, in his well-known C
major study (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10, 7), gives us a good example of this scheme of
fingering, which is carried out strictly, the alternation of thumb and
first finger never being interfered with, even on the black keys, in
spite of the various awkward chords that occur. Thus he gives
perfect freedom to the piquant turns and droll character of the
piece without to any extent spoiling its effectiveness as an Étude.</p>

<p>Over against the Gradus of Clementi, as a remarkable collection
of the most varied pieces, stand certain smaller studies of a
more defined physiognomy. The well-known “Préludes et Exercices”
are written in all the keys, and keep on the whole to the
scale-motive. The “Méthode du Pianoforte,” with its fifty lessons,
collects all kinds of airs and old pieces, provided with marks of
fingering—which, however, are very much behind those of Czerny.
The book is noteworthy as one of the first important attempts to
make use of already existing pieces, not the work of the collector,
as material for studies. Very soon the sonatas of Beethoven
appear in these collections, where they are arranged according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
their difficulty. Here are Handel, Corelli, Mozart, Couperin, Scarlatti,
Pleyel, Dussek, Haydn, Paradies, and the Bachs.</p>

<p>Clementi sowed his wild oats in a series of preludes and
cadenzas which he published (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 19) under the title of “Characteristic
Music.” These were written in the styles of certain
masters and other famous clavier-teachers, such as Haydn, Kozeluch,
Vanhall, Mozart, Sterkel, and Clementi himself. It was half
a jest, and a very moderately successful one; but it is worth
noticing as a sign of an interpretative and compiling tendency.</p>

<p>Among the hundred sonatas and sonatinas, for one or two
players, which Clementi left behind, there is not a single one without
interest or utility from the standpoint of instruction; but from
that of content there is at most only one which can to-day attract
us by its originality or genius. This is the so-called Dido sonata,
dedicated to Cherubini; and even in it the genius is cold. In the
other sonatas we see the body of a Beethoven without the soul.
It is Scarlatti once again—trivial and soul-less; but unlike Scarlatti,
who cut short what had a short life, it is pretentious in its
eternal repetitions. It is a manufacture of music, nourished by the
didactic spirit: compared with the full effects of Hummel it is an
empty style.</p>

<p>The index to Cramer’s works does not look promising. The
Variations, Impromptus, Rondos, Divertissements; the Victory of
Kutusoff; the Two Styles, ancient and modern; the Rendezvous à
la Chasse; un jour de Printemps; Hors d’œuvre, grande sonate
dans le style de Clementi; or the combined composition, in the
fashion of the time, by Cramer, Hummel, Kalkbrenner and
Moscheles, of variations on Rule Britannia—all these are equally
unattractive. The hundred and five sonatas are almost unknown.
Cramer’s importance lies entirely in his Études, which have been
frequently reprinted and arranged. Of the various editions the
finest is Pauer’s English “édition de luxe,” which is adorned with
a fine engraving of Cramer. Here he is all genius and sensibility.
The somewhat highly-coloured nose, on which he himself
used to jest, attracts no notice in the portrait. “It was Bacchus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
who put his thumb there,” he would say; “ce diable de Bacchus!”
The whole delicate spirit of Cramer breathes in these Études, which
to-day are unforgotten and unsurpassed in their kind. Their instructive
value lies in the isolation of the technical exercise, which
is made less exacting by skilful introduction of contrary motion at
the proper point, while the most noble musical forms mount up
from them. They are pieces full of character, and without titles,
to be heartily reverenced. On the other hand “Cramer’s Pianoforte
School,” which went through countless editions in his own
time, has now become useless. The most noteworthy thing we
find in it is a preface on preludes and codas, which, unlike
Clementi’s, does not simply copy the approved models, but sets
forth theoretically a series of “styles” in such improvisations, from
the simplest chords to melodic development. In the period of
public improvisations such instructions were not without their use.
Preluding is still a “style” with us; codas we excuse ourselves.
But in those days a player saw nothing out of place in the direct
connection of such free inventions with the piece before him. And
Cramer was still old-fashioned enough not to object to interweave
with pieces of Mozart all kinds of flourishes—often, as Moscheles
assures us, trivial indeed.</p>

<p>Over against Clementi, the genius of teaching, and Cramer,
the genius of technique, stands Hummel as the inventor of the
modern piano-exercise. Dussek had already, by his unusually
full collection of exercises, accustomed the public ear to the new
state of things; but Hummel brought the charm of the pianoforte
and the effects of the seven octaves within the reach of all. What
our amateurs, from the days of Chopin, know so well, that full and
satisfying tone, that blazing colouration, is all in Hummel.</p>

<p>In his huge Piano School a combination in Hummel of the
old master and the modern player is very visible. He systematises
fingering into the following divisions: (1) advancing with simple
finger-order in easy figure-successions; (2) passing the thumb
under other fingers or other fingers over the thumb; (3) leaving
out one or more fingers; (4) changing a finger with another on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
same key; (5) stretches and leaps; (6) thumb and fourth finger on
the black notes; (7) the passing of a long finger over a shorter, or
of a short under a long; (8) change of different fingers on a key,
with repeated or not repeated touch, and often the repeated use
of the same finger on several keys; (9) alternation, interweaving,
or crossing of the hands; and, finally (10), the legato style. A
stupendous work indeed; and for every head of the fingering, for
every technical possibility, a number of examples are introduced,
with the completest calculation of permutations ever seen. There
are in all two thousand two hundred examples, and more than
a hundred exercises develop the possibilities of playing between
C and G. Before every exercise stand the harmonic ground-chords.
And thus comes to pass the great miracle, that by means
of the utmost conceivable combinations, by means of the hundred
chromatic subtleties, musical figures are formed which no composer
had previously invented, and which lead on to sound-effects
never before suspected. In the examples of an exercise-book lay
undreamed-of novelties in piano-composition.</p>

<p>Hummel himself had a very modest opinion of his own compositions.
He knew that he had made no advance in the path of
Beethoven; and that no greatness was possible outside of it. “It
was a serious moment for me,” he said once at Weimar to Ferdinand
Hiller, “when Beethoven appeared. Was I to try to follow
in the footsteps of such a genius? For a while I did not know
what I stood on; but finally I said to myself that it was best to
remain true to myself and my own nature.” With this determination
Hummel founded the new, rich school of piano-playing,
delighting in sound, and revelling in execution, in which even
seriousness and passion are expressed with pomp and circumstance.
Brilliancy has expelled grace, and the pompous the
lightness of the dance.</p>

<p>Like most of his contemporaries he composed at the piano,
making pencil-notes the while. But he heard it as though he were his
own audience. “When I sit at the piano,” he said, “I am standing
at the same time in yonder corner as a listener, and what does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
appeal to me there is not written.” This was not Beethoven’s
method. Such a conscious striving after effect was not consistent
with absolute sincerity. The concerto was the mainspring of
Hummel’s creativeness. The innumerable concertos and concert-fantasias
take the first rank among Hummel’s works. They
appeared also with quartet-accompaniment, and also with a second
piano, or arranged for one piano. He wrote, unlike Clementi, far
more concerto-pieces than sonatas. All kinds of Variations,
Rondos, Capriccios, and “Amusements,” gratified his publishers.
He wrote dances in the profusion characteristic of the time. The
Sonata in A flat for two pianos is precisely in harmony with the age.
It is only in the second half of the century that original works of
this kind begin to lose vogue, while the duet confines itself to the
drawing-room. The Duet attained its highest point in Schubert.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Hummel’s works bristle with sound-effects. We observe many
full chords, as in the orchestra, when all the groups of single instruments
are employed in full harmony. The treble of the instrument
is for the first time properly used in the grand style, a noble contrast
to the melodic, burlesque, dæmonic, firework style of Steibelt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and the rest. We meet the genuine pianoforte charm of sharp
chromatic successions, where a Bacchanalian tumult of colour
appears to sound a rattling fire of sensuous effects. Even modulations
are conceived from the side of technical effectiveness; and
chromatic insertions or sudden third-passages, charming us in the
vigorous voice of the piano, are of common occurrence. The
various registers of the piano, the bass, the middle, and the treble,
are applied to surprising effects; a note of one register suddenly
thrown into the other gives a colour of its own. Passages rapidly
gliding through the various registers give a glittering spectrum.
Take, for example, such a development as that of the second solo
conclusion in the last movement of the A minor concerto. Here,
starting at the <i lang="it">con dolcezza</i>, we find the pianoforte bringing into
play most of the effective methods of the concerto style. The
simply-harmonised cantabile, for the solo instrument alone; the
repetition of the melodic phrases by the clarinet, etc., with an
arpeggio accompaniment on the pianoforte; the ornamentation of
the phrase by delicate scale-passages; the closing lines of bravura
for the right hand; the showy chromatic scales, accented by superimposed
thirds on the first of every group of four semiquavers; the
sequences of semiquavers descending chromatically; the string of
shakes for both hands which introduce the final <i lang="fr">point d’orgue</i> (four
bars in strict tempo); all these are commonplaces of Hummel’s
style, and are of interest as an illustration of the fashionable music
of the time.</p>

<p>The concerto pieces of Hummel stand in respect of intrinsic
value below the solo pieces. His great concerto fantasia,
“Oberon’s Magic Horn,” is a banal piece of bravura with artistic
references to Oberon. The part of it demanding most execution
is the great storm with its thunder and lightning on the piano—a
somewhat different performance from the tame storm in the Fitzwilliam
Virginal Book. But the solo pieces also are of unequal
merit. Fashionable compositions, like the Polonaise “La Bella
Capricciosa,” which was then eagerly heard, are no longer tolerated.
Hummel at his best, as we know him in his immortal Sextet, lives
in certain delicate turns, such as are common enough in Wagner’s
earlier operas, but were then a style of the time, making use of the
melody both of Mozart and of modern days. The better Hummel
is also seen in certain Schumann-like movements, full of fire and
feeling, such as the fresh pulsating Scherzo “all’antico” of Sonata
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 106, or the concluding movement of Fantasia <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 18. Perhaps
the Bagatelles (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 107) are his most interesting clavier-piece.
Even to-day they show no sign of age; there is not a dead note in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
them. In them the pupil of Mozart is seen in the dainty melodic
lines, such as an Audran has revived in our day; but the forerunner
of Liszt is equally visible. In the last Bagatelle, the
“Rondo all’Ongarese,” he stands precisely between the two
epochs. The true spirit of nationality, as Dussek so happily
applied it in his sonatas, mingles with classical reminiscences, as
the concluding phrase clearly shows. Fugato episodes, derived
from tradition, are interwoven with surprising anticipations of that
method of variation which works by diatonic movement—a method
very familiar to us from Liszt’s Rhapsodies. Hummel then is a
kind of Janus.</p>

<p>Much more simple was Czerny, king among teachers, whose
life and work were taken up with the enforcement of one great
principle. Every piece must be played in that manner which is
most natural and applicable to the case in hand, and which is fixed
partly by the notes before us and partly by the execution. His
genius for teaching was so cultivated that in a moment he could devise
the right study for a student who exhibited any defect. How
precisely he worked in such matters a glance at his “Higher Steps
in Virtuosity” will show. The themes of the Études in the third
volume are called: (1) seven notes against two or three; (2) five
against three; (3) five against three in another manner; (4) passing
of the fingers over the thumb; (5) passing under of the thumb
with a quick alternation of the stretching and retraction of the
fingers; (6) motion of certain fingers while the others remain
stationary; (7) broken octaves legato. This is not the grammar
of Hummel with its theoretical chess-play of possibilities;
it is the method of Toussaint-Langenscheidt, which invents its
exercises from the data of experience. In the great Piano School
the exercises are always continued in the course of the instruction.
The scales are recommended for daily preliminary practice, and
duet-playing is drawn into the circle of regular exercise. It is,
of course, impossible to review the whole enormous crowd of his
works. In addition to the numerous general practice-pieces, which
appeared in manifold combinations, there are the special pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
also: the school of velocity,
of legato and staccato, of
ornaments, of the left hand,
of fugue-playing, of virtuoso-performance;
the art of preluding,
the introduction to
fantasia playing, octave-studies,
the practice of the full
common chord and of the
chord of the seventh in broken
figures; and everything besides.
It is a mighty arsenal
of mechanical appliances. His
works are numbered up to <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr>
856; but all except the Studies
are lost in oblivion; they are
mere hack-work. Even the
greater Studies are, in musical value, inferior to Cramer’s. Czerny’s
great collections from previous masters are the work of a
practical historian. Such are the arrangement of the Wohltemperiertes
Klavier, the edition of Scarlatti, the arrangements
of Beethoven, Mozart, or Mendelssohn for two or four hands;
and the innumerable selections of the most brilliant passages
from the works of masters from Scarlatti and Bach to Thalberg
and Liszt. His practical History of Piano-playing—the first
that ever appeared—was thrown into a didactic form and
appended to the great “Art of Execution.” Every composer
is treated from the point of view of playing, under six heads.
Clementi is to be played with a steady hand, firm touch and tone,
distinct and flowing execution, precise declamation; Cramer and
Dussek <i lang="it">cantabilmente</i>, without glaring effects, with gentle legato
and the due use of the pedal; Mozart with less pedal, clearly,
staccato, with spirit and vigour; Beethoven and Ries characteristically,
passionately, melodiously, with a view to the <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>;
Hummel, Meyerbeer, and Moscheles brilliantly, rapidly, and gracefully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
with definition in the proper parts, and intelligent but elegant
declamation. Thalberg, Liszt, and Chopin, the great innovators,
form a class apart. Czerny’s astonishing genius for instruction
embraces the whole field of the clavier, with a many-sided capacity
that seems almost more than human. A greater teacher there
never was than he. He gathers all into his net, even the works of
his own pupils; he practises everything, even setting it for three
or four pianos; he arranges everything, even isolated passages
of great masters; he composes everything, even penny variations
and Chinese rondos.</p>

<p>In Kalkbrenner we see the lowest type of the time. Externally
a fine gentleman and artistic man of the world, he is
inwardly hollow and vapid. It is hard even to give an idea of this
extreme emptiness; but it is well illustrated in such a piece as the
“Charmes de Berlin.” This great virtuoso won his triumphs in
the worst kinds of salon-music as well as with all sorts of Études,
Concertos, and Sonatas. Le Rêve, Le Fou, La Solitude, Dernières
Pensées Musicales, La Mélancolie et La Gaité, La Brigantine, are
some of these detestable compositions. But his opera fantasias
touch the very nadir. Here a sort of sanction is given to an utter
want of taste. After largo introductions, full of feeling, he slices
favourite melodies into passages, till the contour of the air is
utterly destroyed, and the commonest cadenzas are flung higgledy-piggledy
into their artistic forms, and so we rush off into a sweep-dance.
The fantasia, once the freest outcome of the musical soul,
becomes a wretched conglomeration of fragments of Études.
Kalkbrenner once remarked, as Ferdinand Hiller tells us, “Ze
Tance is a tream, a referie; it begins with lofe, <em>passion</em>, despair,
and it ends wid a military march.” The story is true enough.</p>

<p>To imagine that with Weber we already pass over into the
fairy-land of romance is, alas, a mistake. He would doubtless
have made the transit had not an early death overtaken him in
the midst of the uprising of genius that began in 1820. But, as it
is, his piano music belongs to the technically rich but spiritually
empty style of the time. If he did not still live as operatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
composer and orchestral poet, his piano-compositions would be
forgotten. His technique, successful as it was, is never so rich
as that of the majority of the virtuosos of his time. It is not
hard to perceive that he recurs again and again to certain
motives. The ornamentation which was earlier called “Anschlag”—the
preparatory striking of the under and over note before the
main note, which is seen brilliantly exemplified in the Rondo in
E flat major—the S-curves of the melody, which are a simple
re-arrangement of this “anschlag”—the “pizzicato” notes over
embellishing or broken accompaniments—held notes over struck
chords—broken combinations of three notes, ranging themselves
chain-like after one another—these are his somewhat limited
repertoire. In the Polonaises in E flat major and in E major, in
numerous operatic variations, in Écossaises and popular national
dances, he pays his tribute to the time. But there is no local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
colouring in the variations on the Russian
“Schöne Minka,” or on a Gipsy
song. Dussek and Hummel were in
this point his superiors. The intellectual
themes, like the second of the
C major concerto, show the greatness
of Weber as behind a mask. The
favourite concerto <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 79, if judged
by a severe standard, is only a fashionable
if very clever and successful mosaic
of neat Études with the requisite
melody. The daintiest mosaic piece,
the March, is given to orchestra alone,
as if Weber had felt compelled to
enter his proper abode. Liszt perceived this when he played in
the concerto, and played the <i lang="it">tutti</i> brilliantly with the instruments,
and thus exhibited a remarkable <i lang="fr">tour de force</i>. The four sonatas,
often utterly trivial, are in the main a congeries which perishes
by its eclecticism. As with all his contemporaries, the first
movements, those touchstones of the inner meaning, are the
weakest. The subjects are thin, the framework is that of the
drawing-room; and the other movements have a higher stylistic
value. The powerful rhythm of the second movement in the C
major, the excellent minuet-scherzo, the stirring perpetuum mobile
as last movement are admirable single ideas. But the importance
rises only slowly; the fourth sonata has, not inner meaning, but
a certain majesty. Yet what is this romance, this octave-scherzo
with its rapid waltz-trio, this masquerade of elves, to Chopin, to
Schumann, or even to Mendelssohn? Weber’s most popular piece
is also his purest—the Invitation to the Dance. It is a <i lang="fr">pot-pourri</i>,
such as the age loved; and the very title is <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>. But the
conception of forming the introductory adagio as a dialogue, the
brilliant advance from the ravishing waltz to Bacchanalian tumult
the pure and not virtuoso-like colouring, which rests on this happy
invention, raise the work far above all that is merely fashionable.</p>

<p>The true man of the transition
is Moscheles—double-souled, with
his concessions to modishness on the
one side, and on the other his wealth
of invention and his musical intensity.
He was born out of due time.
He ought to have left virtuosity behind
him, in order to be able to give
full play to his characteristic, not
undramatic, and broad-lined art. To-day
he is almost forgotten; no opera,
as in Weber’s case, preserved his fame
to our times. But his works more
than repay study; if our pianists
would once again take up his C
major concerto, they would be amazed.</p>

<p>In his youth he composed Variations on the Alexander
March, with which he was compelled, much against his will,
when a ripe composer, to dazzle the world. It was one of the
most popular of concert pieces. It is not true that in later
years he altered his style and wrote more soberly. His very sober
Melancholy Sonata (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 49), written fairly early, in one movement,
with its charming accompaniment figure, reminds us of the
Parsifal tremoli. And on the other hand, a later work, the
Danish, Scotch, and Irish Fantasias (this latter on the Last Rose
of Summer), are <i lang="fr">pot-pourris</i> in full modish style. What would
the Virginal Book composers of English and Scotch folk-songs
have said to these variations? In order to avoid the fashionable
appearance, several movements are even written in various tempi,
as in a sonata. In his A flat minor Ballade, on the contrary, he
has with astonishing dramatic force struck the legendary tone in
a free and genuine manner, in a sort of romantic rondo.</p>

<p>Moscheles, who was the first master to arrange for piano an
orchestral score by another writer (that of the Fidelio, by commission
from Beethoven), was unable to escape the operatic rechauffées<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
of the time. His speciality was the putting together of different
operatic airs, which formed the favourite repertoire of a singer.
He wrote such fantasias on the favourite pieces of Pasta, Henriette
Sonntag, Jenny Lind, and Malibran. They are commonplace
enough. Yet this same Malibran, after her sudden death, he
honoured in an “Hommage,” which was one of his finest pieces.
There is in it an unearthly power of invention, a dramatic life,
as if drawn from the stage; spirit breathes in every bar; and the
interest is sustained to the final sorrowfully rising cross-passages,
which strangely forebode the longings of Tristan for the sea.</p>

<p>He wrote many drawing-room pieces, which bore the usual
significant titles—Charmes de Paris, La Tenerezza, Jadis et
aujourd’hui, la Petite Babillarde. Similar titles he superscribed to
his Études, such as his three Allegri di Bravura and his characteristic
Studies (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 95). Among the former are La Forza and Il
Capriccio; among the latter are Juno, Terpsichore, Moonlight at
Sea, Dream, and Anguish. In these the seeker after mode will
be disappointed. They are pieces worthy of Schumann in power
of form; half exercises, half characteristic pieces, reaching that
height of technique where air and étude unite in the closest bonds.
The work which Cramer began has reached the height of artistic
achievement. For here, where meet knowledge, technical sense of
form, and poetic conception, the peculiar musical vein of the age
is found. The fugal “Widerspruch” [contradiction] is an artistic
construction that stands alone; “Anguish” is a penetrating tuneful
picture, which once more reminds us of Wagner; it is a foretaste
of Siegmund’s flight or of the Valkyrie Prologue.</p>

<p>The untitled Études <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 70, which rank as his best work, stand
out as the forerunners of the Studies <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 95. There is the same
delicate characteristic sense; they are a gallery of tone pictures,
among which the twelfth Étude in B flat minor is never to be
forgotten. It is a Night-Piece in the style of Schumann. But all
is calculated for human fingers, not for those of Liszt, like <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 95.
And here we feel patiently after the essential nature of the musical
Étude. We observe the inner relation between mechanical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
spiritual motion. Expression and difficulty grow alongside; the
straining of the fingers is involuntarily the straining of the soul;
their smooth gliding is the gliding of emotion, and the stress of
mind is loosened in the muscles of the fingers as they move over
the keys. It is thus that the irreconcilable at last meet.</p>

<h3>The Romantics</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Where</span> definitions fail, the word appears at the right time. The
word proves the existence of things, even if they cannot be sharply
defined. The word is the artistic form of a transient emotion; it
was made for things which were nameless till its creation; it was
girded with associations which fastened themselves on to this
conception. Such a word is Romance. Romance is not a return
to the popular, to nature, nor to the mediæval, it is no love for the
legendary or the symbolic or the most delicate forms of the most
delicate stirrings of the soul. It was indeed the one of these
things to one set of persons and another for others; but in reality
it is none of these and all of these. If I say it is an <i lang="la">oppositum</i> to
<em>synthesis</em>, or intimateness from the point of view of all possibilities,
I have defined it very coldly. But its essential point seems to be
its reactionary character. It aims not at raising structures, but at
reading souls, and it finds a thousand ways of so doing. These
thousand ways cannot be crammed into one definition. We strike
only gently the chord of the word, so symbolic, so harmoniously
chiming. It is a feeling whose value is not to be analysed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Near the great architect Beethoven lived the first musical
Romantic, the well-beloved Franz Schubert. He felt the burden
of existence as only musicians can feel it. But he had inexhaustible
fountains of consolation, which sang to him melodies almost
more profusely than to Mozart, and he did his utmost to throw
the melodies, without too much pedantry or Titan-pride, into songs,
symphonies, quartets, and impromptus, as the inspiration took
him. He had no long life for working, but he used his time well.
It is now many, many years since his death, and still numbers of
his works are unpublished. His best teacher was the people, and
their songs and dances. The unsophisticated musical feeling, which
came to light in this popular song and national dance—the simple
natural phrases, the speaking soul, the genuine sense for drama—these
were the formative principles of his immortal songs, and
these gave the character to his piano music also. Men have been
studying his numerous national dances as in a Bible of the dance
for fifty years. There are still rare and beautiful flowers to be
found among them; others have been picked out by the virtuosos,
and transformed to hothouse plants in many forms, not always
so stylish as Liszt’s Soirées de Vienne. The case has been the
same with his four-hand Marches, whether Caractéristique,
Héroique, or Militaire. If we return to their original forms, a
surprising air as from country meadows meets us.</p>

<p>He lives entirely in music. From the far land of invention
float the melodies, eternally varying, giving colour to the harmonies,
and pouring themselves out to their very last note. The ear
cannot have enough of them, and, full of the holiest delight,
pursues them to the end of their heavenly course. In Paradise
there is no time; and these melodies are a prologue to eternity.
Schubert died at thirty-one. His D minor quartet, one of the
loveliest compositions ever written, leads us to imagine that he
would have been the greatest musician of the century. But he
has left us only the works of his youth—a youth of intellectual
intimateness and smiling sunshine. In delicacy of musical
feeling we put no one above him. He stands before us in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
small band of original and delicate minds, whose secret can make
the life of higher emotions happy. Let not him who has not
delicate fingers touch Schubert. To play him means to have a
dainty touch. The keyboard appears unmaterialised: only so
much of the mechanism seems to remain as is necessary to render
living the conception of this beauty. In peaceful hours we enjoy
him most, and confess that there is no tone-poet whom we love so
deeply from the heart as Schubert.</p>

<p>In this, those things of their own accord are separated out, in
which Schubert did not follow only his natural impulse to the
popular song. He was in the first place no master or teacher of
musical construction. His scores are simple, and even in his
four-handed duets (he has left behind him duets of surpassing
beauty) whole passages could often be rendered as they stand by
a single player.</p>

<p>Schubert never appears a slave to the arrangement he adopts;
but the movement flows so naturally from his pen that there is no
want of harmony between his idea and its realisation. He is just
as little a special artist of the form. He has written many sonatas—four-handed
and two-handed; but he cares little for the form.
Where he can subject his dainty ideas to this mould, as in the
first three movements of the duet in B flat major, he is interesting
to us. When he cannot easily do so, he has recourse to variations
in the style of the time or to all kinds of academic free fantasias.
In this case he speedily becomes antiquated. But we must again
remember that he has left us only youthful works. His latest
sonatas, particularly those in A major and in B flat major; his
latest chamber-music and symphonies, the wonderful Schumann-like
F minor fantasia, and the Beethoven-like duet “Lebensstürme”
in rondo form, are more weighty in structure and show him on the
way to throw his great conceptions into more recognised forms:
in this style he would have grown into a great artist.</p>

<p>The “Wanderer” Fantasia stands on the boundary line. The
method of writing a free fantasia on a song-motive—on this
occasion one of his own—by which the ordinary four movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
are preserved, was then <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>. That the last movement should
begin with a fugato, which soon passes over into more general
virtuosity, was equally common. In the more purely virtuoso
passages, specially in the quite conventional coda, Schubert is
the very child of the Viennese school. The free fantasias are
rather in Hummel’s than in Beethoven’s style—preserving a middle
path between the two. The form is so free that from the waltz
movement of the scherzo to the weighty fugue, from the song of
the adagio to the conventional conclusion, almost all the styles of
piano music that exist are packed in. But if a song or a waltz
rhythm or a special tone expression appears, then we observe with
what alacrity Schubert sets about his work. He prepares it beforehand
with a certain effort. He caresses the new theme; for
example, on the entrance of the melodic E flat major theme in
the first movement, in the dramatic deep tremolo in the adagio,
and in the pianissimo D flat major waltz in the third movement.</p>

<p>Nothing is more distinctive of Schubert than the development
of the Fantasia Sonata <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 78. The first movement hardly
hangs together. A wonderful theme, depending on delicate touch,
is mingled with empty technical intermediate passages. The
Andante is a Volkslied, arranged as in sonatas; as a whole treated
somewhat feebly, but with sudden small intermezzos, at first in
F sharp major (bar 47), where suspensions in Schubert’s true
style sound in softest pianissimo in the middle voices. In the
third movement a ravishing minuet meets us, running in cheerful
rhythms, with a waltz-like conclusion which anticipates one side
of Schumann, and with a dainty trio in B major, in bell-like tones
and magical retardations such as Schubert himself hardly surpassed.
Thus a G sharp<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in the chord of the dominant seventh,
with which the melodic chain is ornamentally interwoven, was a
discovery rich in wonders. And the last movement with its
original popular dance, which he overheard directly from the
heart of the people where the basses rumble below and the fiddle-bows
spring on the strings; with the two laughing trios, in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>Johann Strauss is entirely anticipated; national dances with a
dainty melody, which conclude so lingeringly in the spiritual
chorale-tone (in C major)—pictures like these music had not
hitherto known. All kinds of foreign national airs had, of course,
been dealt with in artistic style; and Schubert himself, in his
brilliant Hungarian Divertissement for four hands, has painted a
gipsy picture with all his dexterity in rhythm; but the German
national airs had received but scanty attention. Here, at last,
we find the German folk-music, which found in the Viennese
dance-composers its popular embellishment, and in Schumann
its artistic treatment.</p>

<p>With his Impromptus and Moments Musicals, those small
impressionist forms, Schubert placed piano-literature upon a new
basis. Here is found that form of chamber music which is most
peculiar to the piano as a solo instrument with full harmony. It
is not a sonata, which is founded by the great laws of universal
tonic art; nor a concerto, which drags the piano before a many-headed
multitude which delights in distraction; nor an operatic
fantasia or variation on an air, which forbids the charm of free
improvisation; no technical elaborated étude, nor a scientifically
constructed fugato;—but a piece which brings single selected
musical thoughts into a short artistic form, no longer in extent
than the tone-colour of the instrument permits; yet, with all
infelt genuineness, informed with the best effects of the piano,
which the player, as he composes in solitude, feels in full intensity.
Almost all Schubert’s pieces retain something of the spirit of the
time. Some are a kind of variations; others études, a third class
dances; but they are constantly more than mere echoes of the
time; they are founded on an inner genuineness, and much too
full in expression to permit of being included under any category
of the external. In Beethoven’s life we witnessed the way in
which a world-embracing genius gradually threw off the traditional
form; in Schubert we see how an intimate spirit gradually rises
above the style of the time. This development is included
between the Sonatas and the Wanderer Fantasia on the one hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
and the Moments Musicals on the other. At the same period
in which the technical musicians accomplished the outward
emancipation of the clavier, these short pieces (Kurze Geschichten)
made it inwardly free.</p>

<p>As Impromptus the two groups, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 90 and <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 142, were
published. Those of the first group have all penetrated deeply
into our musical consciousness. All roads lead us back again
to the first Impromptu with its simple popular melody in two
sections, which is varied in so many extraordinary ways; and
with that melodious middle-movement, more joyous and ethereal,
than any that had ever been heard before on the pianoforte. Who
can forget the second with the light étude-like triplet-swinging in
E flat major and the mighty B minor middle section; or the third
with its wonderful G flat major melody, its divine modulations and
its captivatingly simple conclusion, revealing unexpected melodic
wonders in a broken chord of the seventh; or the fourth, a light
floating figure with its short Volkslied intermezzi and the long
drawn out melody of the trio in C♯ minor—Schumann all over!</p>

<p>The second group of Impromptus (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 142) stands below the
first in importance. It was with Schubert as with Mozart; good
and bad inspirations came to him alike, and he could not discriminate
them. Yet they contain the dainty A flat major piece,
which demands nothing but a gentle touch; and in the variations
of the third Impromptu (which is therefore no impromptu) the
likeness to Schumann is once more astonishing. It is a peculiar
pleasure to detect Schumann in Schubert, and it is a piece of
historic justice which has often been neglected.</p>

<p>More successful, indeed Schubert’s greatest achievement, was
the “Moments Musicals,” which appeared in 1828, the year of his
death. The first of these is a naturalistic free musical expatiation;
the second a gentle movement in A flat major; the third the well-known
F minor dance—in which a dance became a penetrating
and sorrow-laden tongue—the fourth the Bach-like C sharp minor
moderato, with its placid middle section in D flat major; the fifth
a fantastic march with a sharply cut rhythm; and the sixth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
perhaps Schubert’s most profound piano-piece, that reverie in still
chords, which only once are more violently shaken in order to lull us
to sleep with its pensive and dainty sorrow, its delicate connections,
its singing imitations, its magic enharmonics, and its sweet melodies
rising like flowers from the soft ground. The conclusion of the
trio, in the style of a popular chorale, with its harmonisation in thirds,
is (like many of his harmonic passages in octaves or sixths) exceedingly
characteristic of the popular nature of Schubert’s music.</p>

<p>We have been turning over the leaves of a book from which
Schumann and Chopin might have found matter to fill years of their
lives. In form and colour, melody and movement, the model was
before them. This modest man, who in his Vienna solitude wrote
such things as these for himself, loved a few good friends, but publicity
he hated. A composer who never appeared in public—was the
like ever seen before? In the aged Beethoven the world understood
it; but in this young man it could only reward it with indifference.
He remained willingly unknown, like so many of his companions
in sorrow who wished to be artists in themselves without relation
to others, and without the encumbrance of patronage. The
times were altering in music as in painting. The patronage of the
State or of the Prince is disappearing; the commissions the artist
receives become fewer and more distasteful; he becomes more
intimate and is constrained to offer his works to the public, and
to supply what it will purchase. Supply and demand rule art as
well as anything else: but nowhere is the severance so painful.
Pensions are irksome, and official posts are not to be had otherwise
than indirectly. The struggle after the ideal which is the life of the
artist is purer than it ever was. The type which Feuerbach and
Böcklin represent in painting, that new type of artist who can be
happy without commissions and without honorarium, is first clearly
exhibited by Schubert in the musical world. Publicity, to which
Beethoven at first had recourse, and which he would have carried
further had fate not opposed, was impossible to Schubert. He
had to live on a pension, his applications for posts were rejected,
publishers were timid, and very slowly indeed did his songs win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
their way to favour. Goethe never answered him on receiving his
songs; and Beethoven, to whom he shyly dedicated his Variations
(<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10) as “admirer and worshipper,” only learnt to know him
in the last days. As he began, so he died. The publishers had
still to work through the whole century in order to bring out his
works, which they dedicated in very stylish manner to Liszt,
Mendelssohn, or Schumann: as Schubert closed his eyes he knew
as little as the world that his simple integrity had won a new
realm for art.</p>

<p>Some years after Schubert’s death, in November 1831, a certain
Robert Schumann published as his first work some Variations,
whose theme was formed on the name Abegg (A B E G G). It
was easy to see that the Countess Abegg, to whom they were
dedicated, was a pseudonym for a good lady, whom the author had
once admired as a beauty without otherwise troubling himself much
about her. The theme was worked out a little too painfully, and
the Variations moved in eclectic style among influences derived
from Beethoven, Weber, and the contemporary virtuosos; but their
originality was nevertheless unmistakable. It was not the worn-out
contemporary style of variations; and many sound traces of
that naive dilettantism, which always stands at the cradle of
the new, were easily to be detected. Sudden pianissimo
effects, single selected technical motives, an original melodic gift
for singing with contrapuntal voice-parts and new forms of accompaniment,
rapid harmonic changes by the chord of the seventh,
legendary romance in the finale alla fantasia, the successive release
of the notes of a chord, from the lowest to the highest—all this led
men to wait eagerly for Schumann’s next work.</p>

<p>This next work bore the title of “Papillons”—a title not
unknown in contemporary drawing-room music. But here there
was nothing of the drawing-room style. These butterflies seemed
to come from the regions where Schubert had found his flowers.
Thence they brought a breath of short lyrical songs—a concentrated
breath of severe and restrained beauty. A wonderfully
penetrating heart-felt tone breathed through them. The world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
had now to do with a reflective, deeply musical nature, far removed
from all the merely brilliant virtuosity of the time: it was a
romantic spirit. After the short slow introduction came the waltz,
whose outlines inevitably recalled Schubert; but its emotions were
personally felt. There were melodic passages in octaves for
alternate hands, dying away in the aria with the “nachschlagbegleitung”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
down to pianissimo, a splendid fugato-march in
spirited style, episodes of popular songs, sportive whisperings,
sparkling polonaise rhythms, melodious effects working out of
very gentle full chords, canonic melodies in lively motion, repetitions
of earlier bars in later sections to represent the external unity
of these little stories, and as a conclusion the “Grossvater” song.
The whole is united contrapuntally with the first waltz. The
carnival is silenced—this appears suddenly in words—the tower-clock
strikes six (and high enough on the upper A); a full chord
of the seventh piles itself up gradually and closes the piece.</p>

<p>No one knew what was the chief impulse which led Schumann
to write these “Papillons.” Those who corresponded with him
alone knew that he was thinking of the “Flegeljahre”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of Jean
Paul. From Jean Paul he received his spiritual nourishment, and
those to whom his letters came could tell that he hardly sent off
one without including in them a rhapsody for the Bayreuth poet.
In this intermediate world between the highest earnestness and
endless laughter he preferred to live in ironic love and loving
irony. To reflect deeply on immortality, and at the same time
to drink in comfortably the sweet odour of the girdle cake
which the goodwife is cooking in the kitchen—it is in this mixed
light that the poet stands, who has so characterised himself. The
fantastic boundaries of the real and the imaginary world, of the
most insipid flatness of the animal nature and of the most ethereal
heavenly flights, alike attract him. His delicate soul flies to
Nature, and Nature is to him—so he writes to his mother—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>great outspread handkerchief of God, embroidered with His eternal
name, on which man can wipe away all his tears of sorrow. But
the tears of joy too—and when every tear falls into a rapture of
weeping—whence came these tones in the soul of a musician?
The world had never yet understood them. It knew them in
literary circles, which busied themselves with romantic new creations,
where unknown regions seemed suddenly to open themselves
between the everyday and the legendary, and which demanded
new, painfully twisted words for the wild tumult of their representations.
Where pure music had long wandered alone, the poets
and the æsthetics had now penetrated; and was now a musician to
give them a hand to speak in their tongue? This was a surprising
turn. Upon the musical poet came the literary musician.
The one could only gain; had the other anything to lose? No;
Schumann seemed musician enough to prove that nothing was
lost. None of his friends, to whom he recommended the perusal
of the conclusion of the “Flegeljahre”—whose masked dance, he
said, the Papillons were intended to transform into tones—would
have expected this pure and genuine music from him. I imagine
they all puzzled their heads to know what the wild Jean Paul had
to do with these dainty musical butterflies. And it is to-day even
harder for us.</p>

<p>A delicate musician read Jean Paul, and the grotesque figures
of this “Walt und Vult” combined in him with a world of tone,
which slumbered within him, in those deep regions of associated
ideas which stand at the basis of artistic creation. They there
formed a special union with their musical counterpart, the simplest,
most natural, and least academical creations which the art of tone
ever saw—those of Schubert. So early as 1829 Schumann, who
was then a student, wrote to Frederick Wieck from Heidelberg:
“When I play Schubert, it is as if I were reading a Romance of
Jean Paul set to music.” Jean Paul and Schubert are the gods in
Schumann’s first letters and other writings. He cannot shake
off the ethereal melancholy, the “suppressed” lyrical tone, in
Schubert’s four-handed A major Rondo: he sees Schubert, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
were, in bodily shape, <em>experiencing</em> his own piece. No music, he
said, is so psychologically remarkable in the progress of its ideas
and in its apparently logical leaps. There is a rare fire in him
when he speaks of Schubert. How eager is he for new publications
from Schubert’s remains! Yet, while he is devouring a
volume of his national dances, he is weeping for Jean Paul. In
the Papillons, we hear, there was Jean Paul; and what we find in
them, is Schubert. What was to come of this conjunction?</p>

<p>This question was very satisfactorily answered in the next
work (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 3). This was a collection of Études with a textual
introduction on motives after Paganini, but adapted to the piano.
Considered as a whole it was technical to a degree, yet without
disguising the real Schumann. And what was the meaning of the
Introduction? Every great pianist had already written his
“School” or wanted to write it. Did these barren finger-directions
speak for the virtuoso Schumann?</p>

<p>The Intermezzi (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 4) answered in the negative. These were
genuine pure music without any external pretensions. It was
possible already to recognise the true style of Schumann: the
characteristic features were repeated. Dotted motives, built up in
fugato style; delicate melodies with the “nachschlag” accompaniment
and with other melodies superimposed; reflective repose in
chords; syncopated rhythm; parallelisms of the air in octaves;
all these were as before. In the slurred thirds and the sequences,
and especially the diatonic runs, which seem to gather their
strength as they go, the model was not Schubert but Sebastian
Bach. There was something in this not merely of his absolute,
self-contained music, but even of his means of expression. At
this time of course this could do no harm. In the fifth and sixth
intermezzos Schumann’s personality would seem to have entirely
ripened. This marked propensity to “anticipations,” those pianissimo
unisons, those sharp detonations of C and C sharp, D and
D sharp; the singing legato middle voices developing in the
canonic manner, the absolute transference of whole passages by
means of a single note foreign to the scale, generally effected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
an anticipation; all this had grown into a definite musical picture,
extraordinarily sympathetic, in which soul and technique were
united. With stern sadness the hands grip one within another, to
bring out the “suppressed lyric” of the piano; and a delicate
noble spirit guides them, which delights to express strange things
in strange forms. With stern sadness, as in the style of Jean
Paul, and right in the midst of the music, where an answering
voice intrudes itself, Schumann writes over the notes the words,
“Meine Ruh ist hin”—my peace has departed. This is not as
text, but merely as a comment by the way.</p>

<p>Then came <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 5, free variations in romantic style, on a
theme by Clara Wieck; and <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 6, called <span lang="de">“Davidsbündlertänze.”</span>
They were dedicated to Walther von Goethe, and bore as motto
the old proverb:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza" lang="de">
    <div class="i1a">“In all’ und jeder Zeit verknüpft sich Lust und Leid;</div>

  </div><!--end stanza-->
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">In the later revised edition Schumann cut out this good old
saying, as he omitted so much of the first and heartfelt edition.
“Two readings may often be of equal value,” says Eusebius once
in the aphorisms. “The original one is usually the best,” adds
Raro. Why did not Schumann follow his own Raro? Raro
was the most delicate of the “Davidsbündler.” He was in his
irony, which had drunk deep of worldly wisdom, raised far above
the storm and stress of Florestan and the gentle, simple complaisance
of Eusebius. In Florestan there was much of Beethoven,
in Eusebius an echo of Schubert. Raro was to surpass and
combine them in a higher unity. But Raro is just—rare.</p>

<p>The “Davidsbündler” declare war on the Philistines, and of an
evening bring their dances together, which are then published in a
single volume. Florestan contributes the stormy ones, Eusebius
the gentle ones; while Raro puts in his word as seldom as in
actual life. Such bands of Romanticists we have heard of before;
we think of Hoffmann’s Serapion Brothers, and their zeal against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the Philistines. Herz and Hünten, and all the musical lions of the
drawing-room were to be put aside. There was still music after
Beethoven. David’s companions meant, like their prototype, to
put the Philistines under a harrow. Even the explanatory notes
of his “Bündler” were cut out by Schumann in his later revised
edition. He smiled perhaps at the beautiful fancies of his youth,
when he seemed to carry three temperaments warring in his soul.
And yet this fictitious society was the truest expression of his
romantic soul, in which living music and literary reflection met
together. They were his fellow-workers in his life’s work, whom
he could never renounce.</p>

<p>The moment had come when the world busied itself with
Schumann in somewhat wider circles. It asked after his private
circumstances, and gained the answer—surprising, and yet no
longer utterly surprising—that here an academically educated
man had become a musician—a phenomenon long unknown, and
only possible in this new era of art, in which one could give
oneself up to composition without having to wait for a commission
for each single work.</p>

 <p class="caption">Engraving by M. Lämmel</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Schumann had attended the Zwickau Gymnasium in due
course; and at eighteen, in 1828, he entered the legal profession
at Leipzig. His piano-lessons under Frederick Wieck of course
attracted him far more than jurisprudence; and when, after an
interval spent at Heidelberg, he returned to Leipzig, the die was
cast. The letter to his mother in which he announces his decision
is to-day interesting for the light it throws on his intentions.
Naturally, he thought of the career of a virtuoso; and, in order to
make his fingers supple, he hung one of them in a sling while
practising, with the result that first the finger and then the whole
hand was maimed, and Schumann was saved for pure composition.
Composition is soon intimately knit with love for Clara Wieck, the
daughter of his teacher, whose great talent was to compensate him
for his own lost power. We cannot forget his youthful letters to
Clara, which form the conclusion of the edition of “Schumann’s
Letters,” which she issued. Never were more lyrical letters written.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
He dedicates to Clara his whole power of creation; it is she that
lives in all his pieces, and to create was to think of her. Before
this he tells her legends and supernatural tales. “Look now at
your old Robert; is he not still the frivolous ghost-tale teller and
terrifier? But now I can be very serious too, often the whole day
long—but don’t trouble about that—they are generally processes
in my soul, thoughts on music and compositions. Everything
touches me that goes on in the world—politics, literature, people.
I think after my own fashion of everything that can express itself
through music, or can escape by means of it. This is why many
of my compositions are so hard to understand, because they are
bound up with very remote associations, and often very much so
because everything of importance in the time takes hold of me
and I must express it in musical form. And this, too, is why so
few compositions satisfy my mind, because, apart from all defect in
craftsmanship, the ideas themselves are often on a low plane, and
their expression is often commonplace. The highest that is here
attained scarcely reaches to the beginning of what is aimed at in
my music. The former may be a flower, the latter is the poem,
so much the more spiritual; the one is an impulse of raw nature;
the other the work of poetical consciousness.”</p>

<p>In these words Schumann penetrated into his own heart; and
there is nothing to be added to this characterisation of his literary
music. The new type existed in its purity; namely, the musician,
standing on the height of the representative art of the time, of
which type Wagner was the best expression. There is a strange
likeness in these two opposed natures. What in Wagner passed
over into the external, in Schumann passed into the intimate.
Where the one carries us along with him in an intoxicating rush,
the latter is a personal enjoyment for retiring souls. The one lives
in the orchestra, and plays the piano badly; the other dreamed
first for the piano, then for the chorus, and never was able to
express himself tolerably through the orchestra. Wagner never
burst into tears, like Schumann, when he before his wanderings
played for the last time on the beloved instrument which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
heard all the sorrows and joys of his youth. And Wagner never
wrote to Madame Cosima as Schumann wrote to Clara: “You
speak in your last of a cosy place where you would like to have
me—do not aim too high—I ask no better surroundings than a
piano and you close by. You will never be a kapellmeisterin in
your life; but inwardly we are a match for any pair of kapellmeisters,
are we not? You understand me.”</p>

<p>This man of delicate feeling, who wished to reduce piano-culture
to a system, was editor of a paper, which he founded at
Leipzig in the year 1834, along with certain friends and men of
like tastes, of whom he seems to have valued most Schunke, who
died very soon. This “New Magazine of Music” was Schumann’s
special medium, and in it he published his splendid and very
spirited criticisms and aphorisms; later, when Brendel purchased
it from him, it was of equal use to Wagner, his exact opposite.
Till 1844 Schumann edited it for the most part personally; and
his position aided the spread of his works, which laid themselves
out so little for popular success. Still more effective was the
career of his betrothed, who because of certain awkward obstacles
only became his wife in 1840. This was his most productive year.
It saw the appearance of a hundred and thirty-eight songs, and of
the cycle of Heine’s lyrics (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 24). If the betrothed Clara and the
piano were spiritually united, the married Clara and the song were
equally so. Thus the songs stand precisely midway between his
youthful piano-writings and the orchestral and choral efforts of his
later years. And indeed the piano succeeds better in them than
in any song hitherto written. The accompaniments of “Du, meine
Seele” or of the F sharp major “Ueberm Garten durch die Lüfte,”
are minute and scrupulous pieces of artistic work.</p>

<p>The eighteen “Davidsbündler,” Schumann’s first complete
piano-work, were composed in 1837. Clara contributed the first
bars—a cheerful musical motto. Schumann was fond of accepting
his first bars as gifts from friends. The Romancist was fond of
these incursions into actuality, this poetry in the real. As the
letters A B E G G had once taken his fancy, so later did A S C H.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
And once he wrote in Gade’s family album a piece on “Gade,
Ade” (Gade, farewell).</p>

<p>Schumann’s music is characterised in few strokes; it is never
hard to recognise its features. The interwoven melodies, the love
of “anticipations,” the rollicking humour, which might almost be
borrowed from old drinking songs, the contrapuntal collisions of the bass on which the light waltz flutters down, the cheerfully
pensive codas, the restlessness of his syncopated rhythms, the
sweet lulling romantic tone mingled with wild and vigorous march-motives,
the full effect of broken chord passages of mounting fifths,
the conclusions of the sections abruptly broken off by a staccato
chord—all these were to be seen in spring-like freshness in the
“Davidsbündler.” We have there the “einfaches stück” of
Eusebius, the free recitative in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 7 beginning with arpeggiando
chords for the left hand. Next, “Florestan’s lips quiver.” Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
follow the extraordinarily beautiful E flat major (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 14) with its
airy melancholy; the staccato, passing humorously over into the
“Wie aus der Ferne,” and finally “Happiness speaks out of his
eyes.” Nothing so wonderfully simple, so old-new, so true, so
German, had been painted on the piano since Schubert. And here
was a yet more modern spirit—a mind whose depths were not
merely over-flowed by the streams of music, but were pictured in
delicate musical emotion. The construction is clean and simple;
the language refined and lofty; the whole the consolidated improvisation
of a mind standing at the highest point of representative
art. More perfect improvisations it did not lie in the nature of the
piano to produce. It was the high-water mark of piano literature.</p>

<p>I pass rapidly over <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 7, one of his earliest composed pieces,
the toccata, brilliant in colouring, delicately chased, bold in construction,
wonderful in technique; and <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 8, a concert allegro,
in which he, certainly in an unusual way compared with the
literature of the time, sacrifices a little to popularity, and thereby
crushes out certain beauties. I pass on to <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 9, the “Scenes
Mignonnes” of the carnival, in which neither technical nor concert
problems were to be mastered. The motive of the carnival is
A S C H, which is the name of the home of one of his musical
lady friends and which contains all the letters of Schumann’s
name which are adapted to the stave.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> A bustling ball-play
develops itself, Pierrot and Harlequin appear, a Valse Noble unites
the parties, the mask of Eusebius is seen through, and the gentleness
of Florestan is resumed, the Coquette frisks by, Papillons
flutter round, and the letters A S C H dance a rapid waltz.
Chiarina and Estrella, not unknown characters, are represented;
and Chopin appears in person between them. A short recognition
scene in the time of the Polonaise, in which we hear the dainty
causeries among the marching rhythms—the miniature ballet of
Pantaloon and Columbine—a comfortable allemande, into which
Paganini suddenly darts with his most extravagant leaps; in the
distance a gentle confession of love;—all comes again together in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>the polite and festal promenade of the couples. There is a pause;
and then reminiscences run through the memory; one melody
restlessly pursues another; room is made; the final effect comes;
the “Davidsbündler” begin an abusive march against the Philistines;
they roar out the Grandfather song—“Grandfather wedded
my Grandmother dear, so Grandfather then was a bridegroom, I
fear”—and the people enjoy it, till they all, with a “Down with
the Philistines,” join in, and a galloping stretto finishes the
boisterous amusement.</p>

<p>The inscriptions Schumann inserted later. He took a literary
delight in putting in an “Estrella,” as it is seen in old copper
engravings. It was the pleasure of the delicate man of taste in
labelling. But he laid no stress on this nomenclature; the
relations indicated were as wide as before, when there were none
of these labels. We are reminded of Couperin, whose miniature
porcelain pictures were ticketed just like this moving panorama of
tunes, and in surprisingly similar style. In both the titles were
nothing but a halt in the midst of full musical representation;
they involved no limitation, no point of departure. Under like
tickets, works came into the world which were separated in time
and in tone by whole centuries. Schumann himself almost
thought the titles a trifle too theatrical. The Davidsbündler,
he said, are related to the carnival like faces to masks.</p>

<p>Among the works that followed, technical and purely musical
gifts alternated. As <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10 we have further Paganini Études,
with wide stretches, contrapuntal, transformed in the spirit of
Schumann. Here, as before, the order of publication did not
correspond to that of composition. The F sharp minor sonata
(<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 11) was begun contemporaneously with the Impromptus. It
was dedicated to Clara. It is a romantic deepening of the sonata
form, cast throughout in these small lyrical sections which are
peculiar to the time, but here are held together by an internal
unity. We must feel this unity in order not to cut up the work
into mere fragments. An oceanic vastness spreads over it, whose
tone is struck in the broad introduction. It has a first theme,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
contrapuntal in style, and a second of full-voiced melody; the
working-out attaching new ideas half in imitative, half in étude
fashion. On the third, the A, which drags itself over, the aria
begins its deep-felt lament, in three melodies with the genuine
Schumann-like coda, sighing itself away under the final slurs.
The fresh staccato canon work of the scherzo carries us with it.
Two wonderful trios introduce themselves, the second with the
remarkable recitative. The conclusion is formed by a modest
movement which is put together like a mosaic out of a stormy
quaver theme, two cantabiles, a syncopated motive, a section in
full chords and a stretto. We shall only feel the unity if we give
our playing a touch of improvisation. In a word the case is this;
in a sonata of Schumann what most charms us is the movements
regarded separately; and in the movements, the separate passages.
This Sonata, like the others of his works, must be considered as a
volume of lyrical poems.</p>

<p>The <a id="chg1"></a>“Fantasie-stücke” were the next work. These again
are a completed picture, for the most part broader in conception
than the Davidsbündler, with which they were contemporaneous
in composition. They were the ideal of delicate piano composition,
and have remained so down to the present day. The sweet
“Abendruhe,” the stormy “Aufschwung,” the dainty “Warum,”
the capricious “Grillen,” the gloomy “Nachtscene,” in which
Schumann was thinking of Hero and Leander, the “Fabel,”
alternating in Ritornell and Staccato; the “Traumeswirren,” and
the beautiful “Ende vom Lied,” whose humour sounds again
wonderfully in the intellectual augmentation at the conclusion—all
this formed an extraordinary picture-gallery. The height of
art was attained in the “Nacht,” where the dark rolling accompaniment,
the solitary sighs in the gloomy air, the deep returns
to darkness, the gently sounding and wild shrieking cries and
emotional songs, over the gurgling accompanying figure which
runs through the whole, made one of the immortal piano-pieces.</p>

<p>A more purely technical work was the Études Symphoniques,
written in 1834 simultaneously with the Carnival, on a theme of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Fricken’s. These variations are as significant for Schumann as
the Goldberg variations for Bach or the Diabelli variations for
Beethoven. They are a breviary of all specialities in expression.
All Schumann’s characteristics were here: the strongly accented
fugue, the tied notes with repeated chord accompaniment, the
cantabile with broken chords, the staccato chords in canon, the
dotted rhythms of Var. <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, the complicated syncopations of Var.
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>, the bold phrasing of Var. <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, the Bach-like style of Var. <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>,
the hurrying rush of semiquavers in Étude <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, the duet of voices
with tremolo accompaniment in Var. <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, the march with contrapuntal
treatment on pedal points which concludes the work—all
was here; and all was made into a delicate étude in which that
union of technique and poetry was constantly completing itself in
fresh form.</p>

<p>In the Sonata (or concerto) “without orchestra” (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 14)
which he recast later without introducing much warmth of feeling,
we observe chiefly the strong influence of Bach, which
informs the last movement. If we look closely, indeed, we
shall be often reminded of Bach in the last works, particularly
in the Symphonic Études. Certain slurred ornamental figures,
certain tricks of accompaniment, the play of dotted and triplet
rhythms, the canonic carrying-out of the theme, left no doubt
that Schumann had been trained on Bach, and that he had
strengthened his musical consciousness by the study of a music
in which there is not a superfluous line. The Letters make this
certain. In 1832 he sat over the Wohltemperiertes Klavier, his
Grammar, and occupied himself in analysing the fugues down
to their minutest ramifications. “The use of such a process is
great, and has a morally strengthening influence upon the whole
man; for Bach was a man, through and through; in him there is
nothing half-finished, nothing halting; all is written for eternity.”
All this has a special and peculiar influence on Schumann. The
abstract music of a Bach is mingled with the concrete representative
secondary aims of romance, which find an entrance all the
more easily as this absolute art, free from all words and all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
is ephemeral, is by far the most expressive to the profoundly
musical spirit. Bach’s art expresses every phase of feeling, and
the emotions are so wide-embracing that they never find a
boundary in the domain of reality. This art is the original
realm of all transcendental desires. “The profound power of
combination, poetry and humour in the new music,” wrote
Schumann in 1846, “has its origin for the most part in Bach.
Mendelssohn, Bennett, Chopin, Hiller, the so-called Romantics,
as a whole, stand far nearer to Bach than to Mozart; for as a
whole they know Bach through and through. I myself daily
confess to this high power, to purify myself, and to strengthen
myself through him.”</p>

<p>Along with Bach was mingled in his mind the author Hoffmann.
There was a remarkable elective affinity in the sympathies
of his nature. The “profoundly-combining” Bach took
the place of Jean Paul, and the story-teller Hoffmann took the
place of Schubert. The twists and turns of a writer, whose style
might be called “contrapuntal,” found their continuation in the
musician who brought all counterpoint into a wonderful “incommensurable”
harmony; and the popular simplicity of a musician found
its complement in the dreamy lyricism of a genius who had formed
perhaps a more beautiful anticipation of the whole music of our
century than its actual state has realised. This poet, himself a
musician, valued the most romantic of all arts, “one might almost
say, the only genuine romantic art; for its subject-matter is the
eternal: music opens to man an unknown realm which has nothing
in common with the external world of sense, and in which he leaves
behind all defined feelings in order to give himself up to an inexpressible
longing.” And the poet leads us into a realm of magic.
In the “Kreisleriana,” the garden into which the author leads us is
full of tone and song. The stranger comes up to the young squire
and tells him of many distant and unknown lands, and strange
men and animals; and his speech dies away into a wonderful tone,
in which he expresses unknown and mysterious things, intelligibly,
yet without words. But the castle maiden follows his enticements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
and they meet every midnight at the old tree, none venturing to
approach too near the strange melodies that sound therefrom.
Then the castle maiden lies pierced through under the tree, and
the lute is broken; but from her blood grow mosses of wonderful
colour over the stone, and the young Chrysostom hears the nightingale,
which since then makes its nest and sings its song in the
tree. At home his father is accompanying his old songs on the
clavicymbal, and songs, mosses, and castle-maiden, are all fused in
his mind into one. In the garden of tone and song all sorts of
internal melodies rise in his heart, and the murmur of the words
gives them their breath. He tries to set them to the clavier, but
they refuse to come forth from their hiding-places. He closes the
instrument, and listens to see whether the songs will not now
sound forth more clearly and brightly; for—“I knew well that the
tones must dwell there as if enchanted.”</p>

<p>Out of a world like this floated all sorts of compositions into
Schumann’s mind, as once from the “Flegeljahre” of Jean Paul.
Thence came the “Scenes of Childhood,” where we listen to tales
of foreign lands and men, and dream by the hearth, and play
Blind-Man’s Buff, and then bend forward to hear, for the Poet
is speaking. They are his miniature painting; of a gentle
ineffable grace. Only a “Romantic” can love children thus.
Schumann himself had a particular fondness for these little pieces,
whose smallness was their very essence.</p>

<p>From Hoffmann also came the inspiration of the “Kreisleriana,”
so called after Hoffmann’s tale of the eccentric Kapellmeister
Kreisler. In 1834 Ludwig Böhner, the original of
Kreisler, met Schumann. Once “as famous as Beethoven,” he
jeered at men till they now jeer at him. In his Improvisations,
here and there, we catch a glimpse of the old brilliancy; but elsewhere
it is all dark and waste. “Had I time,” says Schumann,
“I should like to write <em>ana</em> of Böhner to the papers. He himself
has given me plenty of material. In his life there has been too
much both of joy and of sorrow.” Here was a happy conjuncture
for Schumann’s genius. A suggestive bit of life, and its poetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
setting by Hoffmann, which had
first appeared to him as literature,
was transformed into music, and a
work was born whose title, as so
often, he borrowed from a fiction
with whose contents it had but
little connection, except as suggesting
the groundwork. The
“Kreisleriana” was his greatest
work. The artist who brings life
itself, gently transfigured by literary
art, into musical emotion,
never before or since became so clear a personality. The piano
has advanced into the midst of a life-culture. A thousand threads
run from all sides into this intimate web in which the whole
lyrical devotion of a musical soul is interwoven. The piano is the
orchestra of the heart. The joys and sorrows which are expressed
in these pieces were never put into form with more sovereign
power. For the external form Bach gave the impulse; for the
content, Hoffmann. The garlanded roses of the middle section of
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1, the shimmering blossoms of the “inverted” passage in the
“Langsamer” of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, the immeasurable depth of the emotions in
the slow pieces (4 and 6), the bass unfettered by accent, in the final
bars of <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 8, leading down to the final whisperings, are all among
the happiest of inspirations.</p>

<p>The Kreisleriana are dedicated to Chopin; the Fantasia <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr>
17 to Liszt. We are on the height on which the first artists of the
piano are greeting each other; on which breathes the purest
atmosphere of this intimate music; we are on the heights of a
culture which has become the dominating power of the world.
The Fantasia is, so to speak, a confession of this devotion. In its
first movement there is an undefinable romantic feeling as of the
words woven round a legendary theme (he called it first the
“Ruin”), with mysterious passages, answering voice-parts, mystic
ghostly calls. In the second there is the grand triumph, a panegyric
on technique and toil—he called it the “Gate of Victory.”
In the third is the poetic transfiguration (at first called “Star-picture”),
with its ethereal dances and the dying sound of harps,
and the sweeping mist, broken chords with pedal, resolved in
rubato, over which descend the mournful melodies.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>movement is not free from the variation-technique of the time;
the second is a tribute to virtuosity; the third, a half Schubert.
Contrasted with the Kreisleriana of 1838 we recognise an earlier
style of 1836, and we wonder at the strong power of progressive
development in Schumann—a power, which, strange to say, some
would deny to him. But the Fantasia was so happily <em>felt</em> that it
despised time and still to-day stands in the forefront. As there
are Études which seem to hold out a hand to Romance, so here
Romance held out a hand to technique; and the Fantasia, in its
three forms, remained a classic monument of all the contemporary
tendencies. When Schumann published it he cut out the old
inscriptions, its profits being devoted to assisting in erecting the
Beethoven monument at Bonn, and wrote above the first movement
this motto from Schlegel: “Through every tone there passes, to him
who deigns to list, in varied earthly dreaming, a tone of gentleness.”</p>

<p>In the productive year 1838, before the Scenes of Childhood,
Schumann had written three books of “Novellettes,” which were
now published for the first time and dedicated to Henselt. Springing
from his happiest period the music flows as if of its own accord,
and its framework is admirable. They are the most subtle pieces
conceivable for the piano, and the most popular of his compositions,
neat and regular music. Their construction is transparent;
the sections arranged for contrasted effects. In the first piece we
have the March, the Cantabile, and the Canon; in the second the
glitter of semiquavers and the delicate rocking Intermezzo; in
the third the humorous Staccato and the wild B minor section; in
the fourth the dance and the song mingle with the staccatos of the
sequences; in the fifth a Polonaise, in a style approached by few,
and Intermezzi in legato, cantabile, and staccato; in the sixth and
seventh the effective contrasts of scherzo, canon, and cantabile;
in the eighth an air in duet alternates with several trios; all kinds
of sections are attached, a voice from afar, and free repetitions, as
if everything left over had been thrown into it. They are unsurpassed,
wonderfully dainty pieces; but the Kreisleriana were an
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
The charming smoothness of the Novellettes was no longer
alien to Schumann’s feelings. The older he grew the more he
strove to attain a “dry light,” which might easily prove dangerous
to his romantic temperament. He began to despise the exuberance
of his youthful works. We cannot, in reading the last piano
works of Schumann, restrain a certain feeling of pain. Where
once the stream bubbled and sparkled, it now flowed too evenly;
where before the music was <em>felt</em>, it is now constructed. A new
ideal comes slowly into the circle of Schumann’s sympathies, and
that was Mendelssohn. He not only admired Mendelssohn’s
greatness, placing him perhaps even above Chopin, but, as his
works show, he envied his constraining plastic art, which possibly
he mistook for monumental calm.</p>

<p>In piano-literature Mendelssohn is the composer for young
girls, the elegant romancist of the drawing-room. From the sphere
of polite literature, where passion must be trimmed and neat, and
where there is no sentence passed without amiability, and a smiling
<i lang="fr">laissez-faire</i> rules the day, there penetrates into glowing romance
the limitation of this neatness, and a formality well adapted to the
drawing-room. The old Volkslieder, the simple Ritornells, the
tones of aspiration in forgotten old airs, the dances of elves, the
moonlight love-scenes, are all brought on to a parquet for the
delectation of comfortable people. It is a gilt-edged lyricism,
without any unbefitting exhibition of unseemly feeling; a mere
art of perfumery compared with Bach and Schubert. The development
of the pieces shall exhibit nothing to shock; it shall
run on in the most intelligible manner. A dainty accompaniment-figure
is formed, which plays some bars alone; then follows the
melodious and soothing theme, which moves in certain sequences
and delights to rock itself to and fro on related degrees of the
scale. The strophic divisions are clearly defined; small cadenzas
mark the main sections; and at the conclusion there appears a
miniature canon or a vigorous episode, which leaves behind a good
impression on the mind of the satisfied listener.</p>

<p>At the head of this enormous branch of piano-literature stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Mendelssohn. His “Songs without words,” of which six books
appeared in his life and two more after his death, gave the decisive
form to this class of Short Story in music. All the technical
devices of the time, the wide stretches, the broken accompaniments,
the multiplicity of rhythms, are here adapted to the
drawing-room. The Volkslieder are put, as it were, into evening
dress. That in A minor is surrounded towards the conclusion with
octaves, which are merely technical, and without emotional significance.
The Funeral March, compared with that of a Beethoven, is
as if it were written for a set of marionettes. The Spring Song is,
so to speak, set on wires. And all is so beautiful, so objectionably
beautiful! It tells us all through that it is beautiful, and the
composer moves his head to and fro with the music, and says,
“How beautiful it is!” Until at last, when we have grown to
man’s estate, we can endure it all no longer; or at most we take up
once again from time to time this or that song, preferably one in
quick time—perhaps the Spinning-Song, the best of all.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>From these drawing-room romances of Mendelssohn one piece
is to be taken apart, as equally pleasing both to young and to old.
This is the Elf-music. Such music, with its gay dancing of
gnomes, intermingled with a slightly sentimental air, was wonderfully
suited to Mendelssohn’s genius. He never surpassed his
overture to the Midsummer-Night’s Dream, written at seventeen.
There are four of these “Elf” or “Kobold” pieces for the piano.
The first, in the Character-Pieces, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 7, begins in E major, shoots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>rapidly past, and ends very daintily in the minor. The second,
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 16, 2, begins on the contrary in E minor, and concludes in a
very spirited fashion in the major—a very poetical little Battle of
the Mice, with tiny fanfares and dances, all kinds of squeaks, and
runnings to and fro of a captivating grace. The third is the Rondo
Capriccioso (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 14), for which all piano-players have a deadly
hatred, but which is much prettier than we are inclined to think
to-day, when it is worn out. Finally we have the F sharp minor
Scherzo, which was written for the “Album des Pianistes,” with
dotted, staccato, and singing themes, and stands out among his
pieces.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn was one of the few great musicians, whose whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
life, from cradle to the grave, was lived in sunshine and happiness.
From his joyous youth to his European renown as head of the
Leipzig Conservatorium his life was a round of serenity, and at its
zenith he might well die. Sunshine and happiness are in his
works; storm never breaks in, no sigh moves to tears. His storms
and sighings never forget their artistic calm. His pieces cast
friendly glances on all sides, and are quite conscious of the friendly
glances they receive in return. As beautifully as their author
played—he played rarely but willingly in concerts—they
present their technique, so popular, so charming; sounding more
difficult to play than they are. The technical content is chiefly rapid
staccato, whether of single notes or chords; the ornamentation of
melodies in arpeggio; brilliant repetitions obtained by rapid
alternation of the two hands; free obligato use of the pedal; and
a showy use of a facile right hand.</p>

<p>These find their most popular expression in the conclusion of
the Serenade, in the first movement of the D minor Concerto, and
in the E minor Prelude. Popular even ad nauseam are the
Concert-pieces, the B minor capriccio (the favourite fantasia with
march-conclusion), and the two piano concertos, all of which are
practically in one movement, with partial repeats. In technique
these appear to owe an obligation to Weber, for whom Mendelssohn
had a heartfelt admiration.</p>

<p>The third group of Mendelssohn’s piano works, along with
the “Short Stories” and the concertos, are the “Bachiana,” or,
more properly, “Handeliana.” An æsthetic historic sense is a
rooted characteristic of the romantic spirit. Mendelssohn’s studies
in Bach and Handel had a great influence on his development, and
are plainly shown in some of the “Seven Character-Pieces,” with
their soft, gentle, old-world conduct of the melodies, and the
clever fugal movement which seems to set an ancient counterpoint
on to Mendelssohnian harmonies. Here belongs the Fantasia, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr>
28, with its three contrapuntal movements; also the famous E minor
fugue and its companions in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 35, with the appended chorale
and the pompously smooth partwriting, fall into this place. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
constructed entirely differently from the fugue of Bach, which
grows up from within; it is a grafting of a fugato on the trunk of
a drawing-room piece. Finally, we recall the “Variations sérieuses,”
composed in 1841, the purest, most solid, most massive work that
Mendelssohn ever wrote for the piano, without a suspicion of
triviality, filled full with intellectual outlines and harmonies, a
splendid erection, but—throughout dependent on Schumann.</p>

<p>We have thus returned to Schumann, whom Mendelssohn
so nobly repaid for his admiration. This elegant composer, who,
whether as poet, as concertist, or as a follower of Bach, was
always equally clear and plastic, might well appear to Schumann
the fulfilment of his own aims. He had not wavered as to whether
he was called to be a musician, though he had perhaps regarded
business as the easier course. At his pieces he had toiled as Heine
toiled at one of those smooth-flowing poems of his. The doubt
may well have often recurred to him whether the flow was checked.
But from this Mendelssohn the music flowed so easily from the
fingers, and stood so clear and transparent before him. At one
time he believes that the stream is clear, and he rejoices over the
speed with which he finishes twelve sheets in a week. This work
was the “Humoreske,” which entirely puts aside the earlier fragmentary
romance, and throws all, joy and sorrow, into the same
crucible. Thus we gain a piece bearing all the marks of decadent
imitation of Bach’s traditions, and even of those of Schumann
himself, in spite of isolated, delicate, lyrical traits, which occur
specially in the G minor section (Einfach und Zart). We are now
in March 1839. Schumann writes to Clara, asking her why she
chooses the Carnival to introduce him to people who do not know
him. Why not rather choose the Fantasie Stücke, in which one does
not nullify the other, and in which there is a comfortable breadth?
“You like best storm and lightning at once, and always something
new that has never been.” Then also he put his “Arabesque”
and his “Blumen-stück” together, which has nothing but the title
in common with Jean Paul. As a matter of fact, nothing was new,
and everything had been. It had become a question whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
limits of the possibilities of the piano had not already been overpassed.
As <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 22 he brought out the Sonata in G minor, which
he had composed earlier; a piece, compared with the F sharp
minor, rounded and of satisfying content. The final pithy movement
he replaced by one of neater and smoother character. It is
sad to hear him, in his letters, speaking with great <i lang="fr">empressement</i>
of the Nacht-stücke (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 23) and then to find that there is nothing
special in them. As <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 26 appeared the “Carnival Jest”
(Faschings-schwank) which brought back his old style of the
“short story,” but forced into a sort of sonata-arrangement. The
vigorous “Reveillé” in F sharp major, the fine painting of the
restless bustle, the beautiful Romance, the delicate simplicity of
the Scherzino, with its canonic conclusion, the singing Intermezzo,
which in breadth and value on the whole surpassed Mendelssohn—all
these have ill prepared us for the great falling off in the Finale.
This piece was Schumann’s last great utterance on the “subjective”
piano. In the meanwhile the Song had taken him captive, and
dominated his whole nature. In Schumann development proceeded
almost according to classes. After the Song came chamber-music,
then chorus, then the symphony.</p>

<p>Among his later piano-pieces we find all sorts in various
styles—partly interesting as showing an advance upon himself,
partly, alas, mere decadent imitations of himself. The fulness of
ideas and of titles is quite astonishing in his “Jugendalbum,” in
his “Albumblätter” containing the dainty Slumber Song, and in
the “Bunte Blätter” containing the Geschwind-marsch. The
most delicate aftermath of Romance proper was the “Waldscenen”
in which the “Eintritt” and the “Verrufene Stelle” are worthy
of a musical Hoffmann. The Hunting Song is in the style of
Mendelssohn. As late fruits of the intimate piano lyric appear
the sweet variations for two pianos, which we cannot choose but
love, the four-handed Eastern Pictures (Bilder aus dem Osten), in
which Chopin plays a part, and the Songs of Early Morning, and
to Bettina, which show a beautiful touch of a later style, often
reaching the borders of motives from Parsifal. But most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
were certain concertos. Of these the limpid A minor,
dedicated to Hiller—the first movement of which was composed
earlier—in its freedom and colouring recalling Beethoven, and
finally showing traces of Chopin’s influence, is a perfect work.
Finally, we must not omit the Concert Allegro (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 134) dedicated
to Brahms, a brilliant creation, often recalling Bach, with a theme
very much in the style of Brahms, and many interesting repetitions
of earlier figures of Schumann’s own. Why has it been almost
forgotten?</p>

<p>Like Schubert throughout his music, so has Schumann in
his chamber-music left us his youth. He broke off the regular
practice of it at about the same time of life as that at which
Schubert died. During the next fourteen years a slow decline in
the artistic freshness of his works made itself noticeable; and
finally, alas, his genius deserted him.</p>

<p class="p2">At this time some one wrote: “Thalberg is a king, Liszt a
prophet, Chopin a poet, Herz a lawyer, Kalkbrenner a troubadour,
Madame Pleyel a sibyl, Döhler a pianist.” The reader will observe
that Schumann is not even mentioned in this list. In Paris, as
yet, he did not count. There was an utter absence of the frivolous
in his music, and it had none of the qualities which were likely to
conquer the great world. Chopin scarcely ever required his pupils
to play the works of Schumann, and would seem to have had
very little taste for them. On the other hand, it was Schumann
who gave an impulse to the popularity of Chopin’s works in his
magazine, as early as the appearance of the Variations on the
theme “Reich’ mir die Hand” (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 2). Indeed, the rapid and
enduring fame in Germany of Schumann’s only true rival was due
to Schumann himself.</p>

<p>“Chopin a poet.” It has become a very bad habit to place
this poet in the hands of our youth. The concertos and polonaises
being put aside, no one lends himself worse to youthful instruction
than Chopin. Because his delicate touches inevitably seem perverse
to the youthful mind, he has gained the name of a morbid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
genius. The grown man who understands how to play Chopin,
whose music begins where that of another leaves off, whose tones
show the supremest mastery in the tongue of music,—such a man
will discover nothing morbid in him. Chopin, a Pole, strikes
sorrowful chords, which do not occur frequently to healthy normal
persons. But why is a Pole to receive less justice than a German?
We know that the extreme of culture is closely allied to decay;
for perfect ripeness is but the foreboding of corruption. Children,
of course, do not know this. And Chopin himself would have
been much too noble ever to lay bare his mental sickness to the
world. And his greatness lies precisely in this, that he preserves
the mean between immaturity and decay.</p>

<p>His greatness is his aristocracy. He stands among musicians
in his faultless vesture, a noble from head to foot. The sublimest
emotions, towards whose refinement whole generations had tended,
the last things in our soul, whose foreboding is interwoven with
the mystery of the Judgment Day, have in his music found their
form. At this Judgment Day appears to be expressed what man
kept dark within himself, and shuddering sought to hide from the
light. Now it has become free without becoming plebeian; it has
been uttered without becoming trivial. This miracle is sung by
geniuses, who are not cold as marble, nor of such unreal beauty
that we, to our horror, are constrained to believe that there is
an anti-human classicism. No; the angels bear those delicate
features as they weave nobility and joy into one. These are
Polish piquancies, tender and shining eyes of inner fire, with happy
heavy lids, and gently curved outlines, in which pride and spirit
blend together; speaking lips, which have something sweet to say,
and gentle, melting contours.</p>

<p>Chopin gave recitals but rarely. In his youth—who was ever,
as a youth, without visions of a virtuoso-life?—he sometimes did so;
but even then with little enthusiasm. If he was heard in Paris, it
was at very select matinées at the Pleyel salon, to which only
with difficulty was admission to be obtained. The exiled aristocracy
of Poland, the world of Parisian art and letters, and ladies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
sat around and listened. <i lang="fr">Réunions intimes</i>, <i lang="fr">concerts de fashion</i>,
as Liszt called them, were the purest piano-recitals ever given.
The artist knew his audience; and in that small circle there was
free play for the isolated poesy which sounded from the instrument.
A delicate genius had won back for the piano its reserved
nobility. There was here no <i lang="fr">fracas pianistique</i>, no noisy circus-scene
before a many-headed, unknown, indeterminate public; but
courtly culture without the court. When in 1834 Chopin gave a
great recital in the Italian Opera, he was undeceived by the want
of response which he found, and necessarily found, in those great
halls, which only dissipated his dainty playing. He said to Liszt,
“I am not fitted for public playing. The public frightens me, its
breath chokes me, I am paralysed by its inquisitive gaze, and
affrighted at these strange faces; but you, you are meant for it.
If you can’t win the love of the public, you can astonish it and
deafen it.”</p>

<p>Chopin once said of himself that he was in this world like the
E string of a violin on a contrabass. His finely-strung nature
sought retirement, and fate had given him precisely that longing
for rest and harmony which of necessity made the contrabass of
this world excessively painful to him. He ran restlessly from one
abode to another, till he found in the Place de Vendôme the best
for dying in; he became more and more retiring, called for
peaceful pearl-gray carpets, and gave full play to all his decorative
emotions, which are the external proof of a harmonic soul. The
art of his life was driven into isolation, into inclusion in the sacred
recesses of his musical poems; and he knew well how so to level
his life to the external observer, that the biographers—apart from
his one great passion—had never so uneventful a life to record.
The well-known description of an evening with the master, which
Liszt gives in his fanciful but yet so true biography of Chopin, is
so rich in character that reality itself could hardly have done it
better. A melting twilight in the room, the dark corners seeming
to produce themselves into infinity, the furniture covered with
white hangings, no candle except by the piano and by the fireside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
We distinguish Heine, Meyerbeer, the tenor Nourrit, Hiller
Delacroix, the unemotional Minkiewicz, the gray-haired Niemcewicz,
and George Sand with propped arm leaning back in a chair.
The people stand round Chopin in the twilight, and hardly know
whence these magic tones come. [The English reader will recall
the exquisite description of Chopin’s playing in Crawford’s romance
“With the Immortals.”]</p>

<p>We can easily see why Chopin could never compose duets.
Not only did he devote himself exclusively to the piano—he wrote
nothing in which the piano does not bear a part—but he broke
with the custom of writing duets for one or two pianos. A single
Rondo for two pianos, of the year 1828, was found among his remains.
How he smiled once at Czerny, who “had composed another
overture for eight pianos and sixteen persons, and was very happy
over it.” Chopin opened to the two hands a wider world than
Czerny could give to thirty-two. And further, he selects and rejects
with great care before publishing. He prints nothing which does
not absolutely satisfy his mind both as a whole and in its details.</p>

<p>Between his youth in Poland—which was soon closed to him
on political grounds—and his last journey through England and
Scotland, his stay in France stretches like a peaceful background
of exclusively artistic activity. A thousand anecdotes cluster round
him, but only a few of them have stood the test of criticism and
comparison. In his “Life of Chopin”—and there are few
musical biographies equally good—Niecks has collected everything
that is told, and all the arguments against the authenticity
of the various tales. Even upon that famous scene, in which the
Countess Potocka sings the dying Chopin to his eternal slumber,
the traditions are contradictory. There are few letters to help us.
Chopin was too reserved to write them. It was said that he
would rather go right through Paris to decline an invitation by
word of mouth than write his excuse. And of the few letters he
actually did write, the best appear to have been burnt in the sack
of Warsaw. Nevertheless there is a certain charm in being thus
obliged, as it were, to see him in shadow.</p>

<p>A sweet tie bound him to
his native country. The fundamental
characteristic of the
Poles, who united the merits
of the Gaul and of the Slav,
that character of modesty and
resignation, of sadness and of
reminiscence, flowed all the
purer into the works of the
artist. It was easy to see that
almost every one of Chopin’s
compositions, even if it was <em>not</em>
a Mazurka, sprang from the
rhythm and sentiment of the
Mazur (Magyar) music; but it had been all steeped in the
spirit of the Parisian life. A <i lang="fr">milieu</i> of his own was here, of
a charming and cultivated kind, of which there are but few;
the <i lang="fr">milieu</i> of fair Polish ladies, who in Paris lived for their
aspirations and their temperaments. As Liszt said, the French
alone saw in the daughters of Poland a yet unknown ideal: the
other nations had not the slightest suspicion that there was anything
worthy of admiration in these elusive sylphs of the dance,
who smiled so happily of an evening, and in the morning lay sobbing
at the foot of the altar; in these apparently distracted
travellers, who, if they journeyed through Switzerland, drew the
curtains of their carriages lest the sight of the mountain-landscape
should erase the memory of the limitless horizon of their own
native plains. Is not this a paraphrase of Chopin’s music?</p>

<p>That enigmatical daemon, whom fate had allowed to grow up
within the walls of Paris—George Sand—was Chopin’s one grand
passion. This was his one overmastering emotion—but its influence
never faded. The beginning and the end of their association
were varied a hundredfold. His love for her seems to have begun
in hate and to have ended in it; hers began in dreaming, and
ended with emotion; and, as she carried through the episode in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
actual life with <i lang="fr">bel esprit</i>, so she clothed it poetically with the
same. Who can reproach a Don Juan nature with wickedness?
George Sand must have been wicked to play her vampire-part to
the end. But there was nothing petty about the style in which
she played it.</p>

<p>The Powers were cruel who brought these two persons
together. Now in Paris, now at George Sand’s country place at
Nohant, now in travel, Fate compelled them to play this fearful
comedy, in which, at bottom, neither truly knew or comprehended
the other. The woman remained a <i lang="fr">bel esprit</i>, and the artist
remained a dreamer. And in the midst of the comedy stands the
ridiculous idyll of Majorca, in which these two persons live near
each other, in a prison of their souls. The man delicate and
pining, with agile limbs, slight hands, slight feet, silky-brown hair,
transparent complexion, finely-curved nose, quiet smile, voice
muffled “like a creeper whose calyx rocks on the delicate stem,
dressed in wonderful colours, but of such airy texture that it tears
at the slightest motion.” The woman, with an ideal Greek countenance
on a somewhat thick-set body; a face that might seem
to have come down from earlier ages, as Heine describes it, but
softened by a surprising gentleness—Musset’s “femme à l’œil
sombre.” They sit in the midst of the cypresses, oranges, and
myrtles in the deserted monastery of Valdemosa with its chapels,
churches, carved statues, and moss-grown stonework. In the
evening the populace come out and dance ghostlike boleros with
castanets, or at other times the wind howls as if possessed and the
rain falls without intermission. Eating is impossible; ships cannot
come through the storm. A Pleyel piano, brought there with
difficulty, stands in the deserted halls, and Chopin sits at it and
shivers. He longs for home; and she is soon compelled to recognise
that nothing increased his chest-complaint so much as this
winter in Majorca, which she had aided him in planning.</p>

<p>This winter in Majorca was that of 1838 and 1839. It has
long been believed that it gave rise to Chopin’s Preludes. Some
have even fancied they recognised in the dropping motives of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
of them, especially the E minor, the B minor, and the D flat
major, the effect of the constant rain of Majorca. The truth is
that a large part of the Preludes were written, or half written,
before this, and that only the last touches were given to them in
Majorca. Nay, it is even possible that the mighty and fiery A
major Polonaise was conceived and finished under the gloomy sky
of Majorca. Dates are difficult to obtain, and also of very little
importance. Chopin writes his works so entirely from the heart
that they have very little dependence on the moment of their
composition. The single case of an impulse of this kind would
seem to be the news of the sack of Warsaw, upon which he is said
to have written the stormy C minor Étude. Poetic influences, also,
Polish or French, move him only as it were on the circumference.
He is a delicately emotional nature, but far from a literary one.</p>

<p>Chopin’s habit of conceiving his pieces as great wholes is
precisely what renders an analysis of his works impossible.
Chopin, with all the charms we know so well, with all his
wide embracing harmonies, his spirited voice-outlines, is but
one, and one whole: and this single Chopin takes now one, now
another, isolated form, in which, from the original motives, ever
fresh creations are fused together. In every piece he is entirely
present. There are, it is true, a few weaker pieces of his youth;
and Fontana has published a large stock from his remains (these
are numbered from <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 66 on)—a thing to which he would have
objected; he hated this stirring of dead bones. But these pieces
have now vanished even from the practising repertoire of the
following generations. Certain lines can always be drawn over
his general work. We see him, at first, plainly dominated by
his only true forerunner, Hummel, for whom he felt a passionate
admiration, and whose method of execution he has only further
enlarged; so that in Chopin’s daintiest colourations a keen
observer can detect the relics of the old “manieren” and ornamental
flourishes. The E flat major Rondo, the Concert-Polonaise,
and, above all, the two Concertos in E minor and
F minor, show clearly the influence of Hummel, notably in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
their jerky insertion of étude-like murmuring motives, their
simply broken accompaniment to the cantilena, their brilliant
effects in the high registers, their easy drawing-room phrases,
and their surprisingly Mozart-like charm in melodic line. But
the concertos, the most fairy-like in the whole range of that
class of literature, already point to regions so far out of the
reach of Hummel that they cannot be exhaustively summed up
under that category. Scarcely to be separated chronologically
from them are the pure commencements of the genuine art of
Chopin, which is clearly visible in the first Mazurkas, and
stretches far into the forties. Even those remarkable spirited
variations in B flat minor, dated 1833, on an operatic theme of
Herold, in which Chopin seemed to make a concession to fashion,
are not removed a hair’s breadth from the distinction of his best
style. In 1840, a year so fruitful for Schumann also, appeared
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 35 to 50. Chopin was thirty-one, the age at which Schubert
died. At last a certain later style has been marked off; restrained,
contrapuntal, and yet unfettered. His most brightly-coloured
examples he gave in the wildly poetical Barcarolle, the spiritual
B major Nocturne, and the full-bodied Fantasia-Polonaise.</p>

<p>Chopin’s work shows but few departures from his regular
lines. Of these we may mention the beautiful pasticcio of the
F minor Fantasia, which should be played with a sort of extempore
laxity; the Barcarolle; the Tarantelle; the Bolero; and
the refined Berceuse, in which, over the uniform accompaniment,
a splendid succession of motives ascends or descends; which form
an epitome of Chopin’s “manieren,” as the Goldberg Variations
were of Bach’s, the Diabelli of Beethoven’s, or the C sharp minor
of Schumann’s. Apart from these his pieces fall into symmetrical
groups, each of which has its own pronounced character.</p>

<p>His sonatas remain most strange to us; they are sonatas in
the strict sense as little as the other sonatas by the Romantics.
Chopin cares so little for form that he avoids the recurrence to the
first theme. The whole falls into fragments: the B flat minor has
its wild first theme and its dainty second; the capricious Scherzo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
the Funeral March, which, alas! has become so popular (it was
introduced into the Sonata only by an afterthought), and the
spirited unisono storm of the last Presto, right on to the
fortissimo concluding bar. But from the B minor Sonata, the
sultry Largo, and the last movement, a kind of giant boating-piece,
strike us as most remarkable.</p>

<p>Chopin finds his true form in the Ballades and Scherzi. This
is the extempore form, which even in the Impromptus has for long
not been so unfettered. The dividing lines of the sections are
drawn from free invention, and the thought is constrained by no
scheme. An artistic order introduces the rhythm of the arrangement
with which the moment would have been obliged to dispense.
It is naturalism lifted into the sphere of discrete art.</p>

<p>The improvised form is shown in the Preludes still more
purely, but with less pretension. They are a succession of
musical aphorisms, from the sketch to the finished piece, running
through the gamut of all forms.</p>

<p>In these Ballades, Scherzi and Preludes, we reach again one
of those solitary peaks of piano literature in which improvisatorial
invention and artistic construction meet again in a higher unity.</p>

<p>The Études crown the efforts of this period, to bring technique
and tune into the friendly relation peculiar to them. While
we admire their mechanical value in point of polyrhythmical
effects, wide stretches, double trills, independence of the left hand,
airy piano-effects, freedom of the wrist, and quickness of finger-change,
we praise their poetry, the grace of the C major or the
magic of the A flat major, the solemnity of the C sharp minor, or
the intoxication of the G flat major, the Titanic force of the C
minor, or the melancholy of the E flat minor.</p>

<p>The Nocturnes—with the silken web of the D flat major in
their midst—are the high songs of melody which Chopin nowhere
else has framed with such entrancing aspiration or such broad
exclamatory sighs. But the dances are the high songs of rhythm,
to which never yet was so intellectual a homage paid. The
Polonaises have the <em>galant</em> and knightly features of the old Polish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
nobility; and Chopin’s head rears itself in them more proudly
than one would have expected from his feminine nature. But the
Mazurkas are bourgeois little joys, half bathed in sorrow, half
crushing their pain in the jubilation of the rhythm—an unparalleled
series of intellectual inspirations. In the Waltzes we
have only a higher kind of Mazurkas, with less of the national
spirit, like Poles in the Parisian drawing-room. The slow Waltz
in A minor, not without reason, was dearest to Chopin’s own
heart.</p>

<p>Chopin’s playing was the rapture of his contemporaries. All
agree that his individuality could only be made intelligible by
himself. How long did Moscheles torment himself with the
remarkable harmonic transitions which he found in Chopin’s compositions!
But when he heard the master himself, all doubt
vanished; what had seemed violent now became self-intelligible.
Chopin’s playing was dainty and airy; his fingers seemed to glide
sideways, as if all technique were a glissando; even the Forte was
in him not an absolute but a relative forte—relative, that is, to the
gentle voice of the rest; and it rises, the older he grew, so much
the less by force than by a subtle play of touch. All execution
has made way for a certain free extempore poesy; the <i lang="it">rubato</i>
softens the harshness of bar-accent. Liszt’s definition of the rubato
is well known—“You see that tree; its leaves move to and fro in
the wind and follow the gentlest motion of the air; but its trunk
stands there, immovable in its form.” Chopin seems never to
have carried the rubato so far that this trunk itself would have
stirred. Once already had a player arisen who cultivated this
graceful and airy kind of execution. Field, a Scot by birth,
Clementi’s pupil, a pale and dreamy man, had anticipated the
delicate breadth of Chopin’s touch; and the world had been enraptured
with his melancholy renderings by means of apparently
motionless hands. Alongside of not very important sonatas,
concertos, and rondos, he had published a series of song-like
pieces, which he called “Nocturnes,” and in which he put to special
use his longing melodies, his dreamy <i lang="it">portamenti</i>, his rose-chains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
airy colourations. Compared with Chopin’s Nocturnes, these must
necessarily appear pale and even monotonous; but in his whole
essence, in the form of his pieces, and the delicacy of his touch,
Field was a prelude to Chopin—as Dussek or Louis Ferdinand
were in their kind. When Chopin once played before Alexander
Klengel, Clementi’s pupil, the latter was strongly reminded of
Field. And when Chopin, after his arrival in Paris, conceived the
idea of taking further lessons under Kalkbrenner, whose delicate
playing he admired above everything, the latter likewise thought
that the style reminded him of Cramer, but the playing of Field.
“Were you Field’s pupil?” he asked. Chopin’s true teacher, the
forgotten Elsner of Warsaw, had had no share in it. Chopin had
formed his own playing, as he formed his own style. In early
years he had a mania for width of stretch, and even invented a
device for stretching the fingers. The experiment was fortunately
more successful than Schumann’s attempt to increase the independence
of the fingers by means of a sling. The difference is
noteworthy: Chopin aimed at a richer impression of voluptuous
fullness in the chords; Schumann at increased independence of
part playing.</p>

<p>Chopin, as a sensitive artist, laid special stress on the kind of
instrument he used. In his youth he would only willingly play
on Graf’s pianos; in Paris only on those of Pleyel, whose silvern
muffled tone was specially attractive to him. In those of Erard
he thought the tone too insistent. “If I am in a bad humour I
play an Erard, and easily find there the tone ready-made. But if
I am in the humour, and strong enough to make my own tone, I
use a Pleyel.” The fingering, also, he regulates for himself. For
the sake of a better execution he never objects to put his thumb
on a black key in suitable places, or to glide with one finger over
two keys, or to let longer fingers pass over the shorter without
using the thumb. In his Études he has expressly written marks
for many such naturalistic fingerings.</p>

<p>The special character of Chopin’s method, which in this literature
created an epoch, consisted in an effective use of three voices.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
Of course it is not meant that he constantly writes strictly in three
parts; quite on the other hand, he has made a quite unique use
of the unison in the B flat minor Sonata, in the fourteenth and
eighteenth Preludes, and in the second movement of the F minor
Concerto; and there are plenty of examples in him of the simple
accompaniment of a simple melody. But the peculiar charm of
his technique begins only in the parallel application of three voices
(I am not using this term in the contrapuntal sense), in the laying
alongside of three motived systems, three musical thoughts, three
principal paths. In the Berceuse, for example, upon the heels of
the one voice over the accompaniment treads instantly a second,
and the threefold combination of accompaniment and two overparts
is carried through in all possible variations. The two overparts are
no less present in several passages, which appear on paper merely
as zigzag runs, which bind together continuously the two melodic
lines. In favourable cases, as in the boldly accented chords
toward the conclusion of the B flat minor Scherzo, this peculiar
line-counterpoint is carried to an extreme. The fusion of unfusable
things in melody, rhythm, and harmony is the new synthesis
by means of which this art advances. The charm of certain
melodies of Chopin is increased by their taking up intervals foreign
to the key, which affect us half with Eastern, half with ecclesiastical
associations, but on closer inspection these are seen to be
merely due to the collision of two melodic lines.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> There are, for
example, resolutions of suspensions, which are postponed for the
moment; the main melody of the First Ballade, the whispering
second Intermezzo of the famous B flat major Mazurka, the D in
the C sharp minor Nocturne, the A in the B minor Prelude, are
instances. It is a <i lang="it">rubato</i> of melody: a musical, not a rhythmical
rubato. If a section of a Mazurka in <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 30, 3 is repeated pianissimo,
it does not shock us, if certain notes already played reappear
a semitone lower, precisely as if the dynamic weakening had a
musical weakening as its result. It is an effect of intellectual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>naturalistic charm. Everywhere the straight line is by preference
avoided. Suspensions (retardations) are boldly prolonged at the
conclusion of a bar, as in the B flat major Mazurka or in the
stretto of the G minor Ballade. The melodies wind themselves
round invisible axles, and the <i lang="it">fioriture</i> play in turn round the
supports of the melodies. The time is ignored, incommensurable
passages can only be worked in by the <em>feel</em>, triplets and duplets
are mingled with each other, or a wonderful pseudo-rhythm, as in
the F major theme of the A flat major Ballade, makes us waver
pleasantly between two time-emotions. There is constantly a
combination, by the two independent hands, or by the independent
movement of an upper or under group of fingers in one hand:
this is the extreme attainment of artistic finger-mechanism on a
harmonic instrument.</p>

<p>The sensuous charm of sound in Chopin’s music rests essentially
on this <em>use</em> of the individualisation of the fingers. Formerly
the fingers had only been tools, which rendered on the piano the
general many-voiced piece. Now, however, a music had arisen
from the essence of the fingers which was quite peculiar to the
piano. The pedal held the dissected music again together. The
left hand continues its own melodic lines under the right, as we
find in the E minor Prelude, in the C sharp minor Étude, in the
middle movement of the C sharp minor Polonaise, and the Scherzo
of the B flat minor Sonata, in the F sharp major Impromptu, in
the G minor Ballade, in the A flat major Waltz (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 34, 1), or in
so many Études with characteristic full figuration in the left hand.
Or in passages which run swiftly enough to allow this little acoustic
deception to grow into a charm, the two melodic passages or one
melody unite with their retardation notes into those zig-zag contours
which became Chopin’s distinguishing mark. There is a
long spirited series from the first Hummel-like pieces in the E
minor Concerto, through the ethereal sounds in the middle movement
of the third Scherzo, to the B minor Scherzo which forms its
wild main movement entirely by means of this mannerism. The
concluding trills of the concertos, the arpeggios of wide chords;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
the ornamentations in the middle of the chords, take a share in
the using-up of the polyphony for sound effects; until at last we
meet the threefold or fourfold web in the concluding sections of
the Barcarolle.</p>

<p>We have, in these last phrases of Chopin been reminded of
the influences of Bach, and in fact, the extreme individualisation
of the fingers leads us of necessity back to Bach, in whose works
the fingers are called upon to perform the last possibilities of
many-voiced music. Throughout it all Chopin knew that Bach
is nature in music. When he was practising for his recitals, he
played, not Chopin but Bach.</p>

<p class="p2">[The English pianist and composer, William Sterndale
Bennett, contemporary and friend of Mendelssohn, equally popular
as a musician both in Germany and his own country, demands
notice in this place. If England has not succeeded in forming a
definite musical style for itself in the nineteenth century, at least
it can take credit for having possessed one composer who may
be called “unique” in the true sense of the word. As far as
his powers extended, Sterndale Bennett achieved the highest
distinction. There is no one <em>like</em> him—his pianoforte music
(on which alone he can afford to take his stand) ranks quite
by itself in expression, character, and technical difficulty. Those
who class him with Mendelssohn look merely on the surface,
and show themselves incapable of making a worthy distinction.</p>

<p>Sterndale Bennett’s music is never <em>weak</em>, although for the
most part cast in a delicate mould. On the other hand, he
seems to have felt that the “grand” style was out of his
reach, and that it was no part of his business to act the strong
man. Accordingly, he seldom shows any inclination to venture
too high a flight. This alone suffices to distinguish him from
Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>Probably most pianists, when speaking of Sterndale Bennett,
would naturally think first of the Three Sketches (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 1,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
2, 3), “The Lake,” “The Millstream,” and “The Fountain.” And
it would be difficult to better this as a specimen list—the first as
a perfect expression of natural tranquillity, the second as an
example of Sterndale Bennett’s peculiar technical difficulties, and
the last as a complete imitative picture.</p>

<p>The “Six Studies” (<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 11) are quite characteristic. Their
musical value is very evident to the hearer; it is only the player
who can appreciate the perfection of execution they demand.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3, in B flat, is the gem of the set. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 6, the octave study in
G minor, approaches real power in the first section. The <i lang="it">cantabile</i>
second subject is an exemplification of the quite inimitable style
of the composer. Amongst other miscellaneous pieces the following
must be named—the Fantasia in A, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 16, dedicated to
Schumann, especially the first movement, with its lovely melody
on arpeggiando accompaniment—the Caprice in E (with orchestra),
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 22, an excellent proof of Sterndale Bennett’s mastery of the
“concerto” manner—the Rondo piacevole in E, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 25, where
one notes the wonderful grace of the first subject, the expressive
power of the second.</p>

<p>Sterndale Bennett comparatively seldom rises to emotional
heights; however, see his Op, 28, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1, the Introduction and
Pastorale in A, particularly the early bars of the Introduction,
where, if he does not attain the seventh heaven of a man or an
archangel, he at least reaches the clear empyrean of the happy skylark.
He touches the same high level towards the close of the
Pastorale itself. For other examples of his capacity for the expression
of deep feeling compare also the third and fourth movements
of the “Maid of Orleans” Sonata, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 46, an idyllic work, almost
unknown, and scarcely ever played. Description of this Sonata
would be useless: it should be studied. It shows Sterndale
Bennett at his best and worst—it shows all his strength, and
some of his peculiar weaknesses.</p>

<p>Space prevents more than the mere mention of other works in
which the pianoforte takes a prominent part:—The Concerto in F
minor, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 19 (played by Sterndale Bennett himself “at the concerts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
of Leipsic”); the violoncello and piano duet, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 32; the
Sextett for two violins, viola, violoncello and contrabasso, with
pianoforte, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 8; the pianoforte Trio in A, <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 26; and, not least
important, from the point of view of this book, the twelve songs,
the accompaniments of which are of ideal beauty.]</p>

works and songs are abundantly feeble; but we, in England at least, must always owe
Mendelssohn a debt for having provided an easy path by which amateurs have been led,
now for many years, towards the high and true romance of men like Schubert, Bach, and
the others. But it is necessary, and indeed the special duty of an Englishman, to advise
young persons who read this book, that Mendelssohn <em>at his best</em> is what they should get
to know, and that unless they have “Elijah” and “St Paul” by heart, the adverse
criticism of the composer of those works is denied them. Even in these two great
oratorios it requires no practised Diabolus to find their weaknesses—but what shall an
honest man say of “Yet doth the Lord see it not,” or “The nations are now the Lord’s,”
in spite of the wretched weakness of counterpoint in the fugal parts of the latter movement?
The man who could write such things is a great man and a true “romantic.”</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> Cases of this kind are common in Purcell and Bach. Examples are easily quoted.

<h3>Liszt and the Present Time</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of the era
of present-day piano-art, perhaps
also at the culmination of
all independent and advancing
piano-art, stands Franz Liszt.
The artistic phenomenon of
Liszt is yet so near to us, that
it is still misunderstood. Even
to-day he has fanatical friends
and bitter foes: blind assailants
and diplomatic defenders. And
through it all, the whole world
of piano-playing stands under
his influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
This was possible because Liszt was a developed artistic nature,
who did not fall in with the established scheme, was by everybody
differently understood, differently loved, differently hated. We
can distinguish three types of artists. The one is the rapid
composer, whose new thoughts readily find their new suitable
form. The second class is that of the artists of the will—great
innovators, like Manet and Degas among the painters, who
worked not so much by their visible productiveness, as by their
personal influence, exerted from day to day; an influence which
after their death seems almost inconceivable. The third consists
of the compilers, classics in the historical sense, who form a
synthesis of all the constituent parts, a unity of opposites, into
which history continually diverges, a conjunction of all begun
and severed paths, the complete culture of a time made living.
Liszt belongs to none of these types; he belongs to the last
two <em>together</em>. The union of the innovator and the classic
forms his essence; and in understanding this lies the complete
comprehension of him. He possessed a double power, which
influenced the world as it did, because the world never saw the
one half of his nature before the other.</p>

<p>Liszt the revolutionary cast his seed wide into the world. His
system of patronage, founded on artistic feeling, not merely
smoothed the way for Wagner and Berlioz, but assured to every
suppliant the preservation of a modicum of self-respect and a
modicum of hope. He pointed out to the modern musical
development, in a kind of theoretical praxis peculiar to himself,
the paths which led from the revolutionary principles of Berlioz
to the popular musical realism of to-day. He scattered over
both hemispheres the seeds of intimate personal instructions, of
great and small disclosures; so that even now eternal gratitude
to this most kind-hearted of all artists is felt over the world.</p>

<p>Liszt the compiler is a new Liszt. Here the revolutionary
remained apart, and the new Liszt came forth, who rushed in
undreamed-of splendour through real and imagined worlds. He
gathers cultures, a princely collector, with the crown of rare desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
upon his head. The world did not know that this same man
could pass through times of quiet creation and thought. He is a
man of the world of the highest <i lang="fr">savoir faire</i>, a writer of bewitching
elegance, a conqueror who makes nought of the boundaries of
peoples, a king despising kings, a demigod as conductor of
tumultuous musical festivals, and in his works, which seem to
appear daily in countless, uncontrollable numbers, a classical
combiner of that which is and that which has been. It was he
who united composition and interpretation, music and poetry,
romance and virtuosity, Olympian and Titan, Beethoven and
Paganini. Everything that the piano had experienced, the mystic
longings of the old counterpoint, the love of variation of Bird and
Bull, the ornamentation of Couperin and Rameau, the sensuous
delight in sound of Scarlatti, the absolute art of Bach, the charm
and formal beauty of Mozart, the pain of Beethoven crying for
release, the intellectual confessions of the unique triumvirate,
Schubert, Schumann, and Chopin—the rays of all met in him. A
true combiner, he did not jumble these cultures in a learned and
academic fashion together in himself, but he developed their
common medium, in which they could test their mutual effects,
with ever new charms.</p>

<p>The life of Liszt necessarily prepared him for this mighty
combination. It is a co-ordination of cultures, each of which,
singly experienced, might have sufficed for an ordinary mortal.
He passed through six such lives in the various parts of his
existence. As “petit Litz” he lived the life of a precocious
much-loved child; then in Paris he penetrated to the depths of a
romantic idealism, which drew closely together the men of that
fruitful epoch; next, with the Comtesse d’Agoult he lived for five
years the free and productive life of a wandering artist: then he
experienced the glories of European renown as a virtuoso; next,
he exerted himself in Weimar as the pioneer of the modern style;
and finally, in Rome, Buda-Pest, and Weimar, he lived the peaceful
life of a ruler, having attained the heights of worldly honour and
equally those of that conquest of the world which found its symbol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
in his priestly robe. Lina Ramann had the courage to make three
volumes of biography out of this unparalleled life, in which the
unique material is spoilt by doubtful German and uncritical
enthusiasm. Liszt is in her books not the subject but the hero of
the tale; and the wickedness of women is the theme. The
Comtesse d’Agoult receives the same
measure as George Sand in Niecks’
“Life of Chopin.” It is remarkable,
how in the archives which are arranged
after the death of great men, so little
is said of humanity and so much of abstract
right. Is the moral order of the
world so inexorable that even its fairest
opponents must be docketed and ticketed
in accordance with it?<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In the romantic Thirties, and in Paris,
men thought otherwise. In the freedom
of that society Liszt’s personality received
its stamp. In Paris he remained
after the tour of the world which he
made in childhood, on which Beethoven
had kissed him; and in Paris he learned
the elegance of a man of the world, and
a depth of pantheistic thought. These were his two opposite poles.
And very soon this mental culture raised him far above all his
contemporaries in his profession; Chopin alone was worthy to
be placed at his side. It was a good preparation for those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>triumphs of virtuosity that were soon to come, which were to
transform him from a delicate Parisian into a European citizen.
The splendour of virtuosity lay like the eternal sun over Paris.
From time to time something would happen to cast even that
splendour into the shade. In the twenties came Moscheles;
then the wonders of the little Liszt; and now the appearance
of Thalberg. Thalberg, the natural son of a prince, a ravishing
and brilliant person, a cavalier through and through, came to
Paris in 1835 and took her by storm. He had a luxuriant,
fascinating execution, in which the silken glitter was that of
the <i lang="fr">fontaine lumineuse</i>; and he had besides the peculiarity of
holding the middle melody supported by the pedal, both hands
taking part, while they enfolded it in arabesques of chords. In
the rivalry with him Liszt was the complete and foursquare
man: no longer the “petit Litz,” standing on the height of
the time, but the mature Liszt, with his “profil d’ivoire,” who
left the time far behind. Liszt and Thalberg were both <em>gentlemen</em>.
They never showed such animosity as their respective partisans,
who split Paris as once it had been split by the Gluckists and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
the Piccinists. But their rivalry had nevertheless something
dramatic in it, and in it lay a regard for piano-culture never
yet seen. The crisis of the struggle was reached on the 31st
of March 1837, when the Princess Belgioso ventured to invite
both Liszt and Thalberg to a benefit-concert, at which the price
of the tickets, forty francs, was proportioned to the character of
the company. Hitherto each had performed on his own account;
and each had been applauded for himself. Both came; and both
played. The following conversation gives the decision of the
audience—“Thalberg est le premier pianiste du monde!” “Et
Liszt?” “Liszt, Liszt est—le seul!” It seemed a drawn
match. But meanwhile the depth of Liszt’s artistic character
was conquering though unobserved. Liszt had in an article
severely censured the empty compositions of Thalberg. Fétis,
the musical historian, took the other side, and maintained
strongly that not Liszt but Thalberg was the man of the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
school. A few years only had to pass, when people grew sick
of playing Thalberg. The broader humanity of Liszt’s art had
won the victory over external glitter in popular dress—a victory
which Liszt’s personality could not gain over that of Thalberg.
Thenceforward Liszt’s supremacy was uncontested.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1837, Liszt made a confession, in an essay
written for the <cite>Gazette Musicale</cite>, which was the greatest flattery
that ever the piano received from one of its masters. Liszt refuses
to go nearer to the orchestra or to the opera. “My piano is to
me what his boat is to the seaman, what his horse is to the Arab:
nay, more, it has been till now my eye, my speech, my life. Its
strings have vibrated under my passions, and its yielding keys have
obeyed my every caprice. Perhaps the secret tie which holds me
so closely to it is a delusion; but I hold the piano very high. In
my view it takes the first place in the hierarchy of instruments;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
it is the oftenest used and the widest spread.... In the circumference
of its seven octaves it embraces the whole circumference
of an orchestra; and a man’s ten fingers are enough to render
the harmonies which in an orchestra are only brought out by the
combination of hundreds of musicians.... We can give broken
chords like the harp, long sustained notes like the wind, staccati
and a thousand passages which before it seemed only possible to
produce on this or that instrument.... The piano has on the
one side the capacity of assimilation; the capacity of taking into
itself the life of all (instruments); on the other it has its own
life, its own growth, its individual development.... It is a microcosm,
a micro-theus.... My highest ambition is to leave to
piano players after me some useful instructions, the footprints of
attained advance, in fact a work which may some day provide a
worthy witness of the labour and study of my youth. I remember
the greedy dog in La Fontaine, which let the juicy bone fall from
its mouth in order to grasp a shadow. Let me gnaw in peace at
my bone. The hour will come, perhaps all too soon, in which I
shall lose myself and hunt after a monstrous intangible shadow.”</p>

<p>It is due in very great measure to the example of Paganini’s
violin-playing that Liszt at this time, with slow, deliberate toil,
created modern piano-playing. The world was struck dumb by
the enchantment of the Genoese violinist; men did not trust their
ears; something uncanny, inexplicable, ran with this demon of
music through the halls. The wonder reached Liszt; he ventured
on <em>his</em> instrument to give sound to the unheard of: leaps which
none before him had ventured to make, “disjunctions” which
no one had hitherto thought could be acoustically united: deep
tremolos of fifths, like a dozen kettle-drums, which rushed forth
into wild chords; a polyphony which almost employed as a
rhythmical element the overtones which destroy harmony; the
utmost possible use of the seven octaves in chords set sharply
one over another; resolutions of tied notes in unceasing octave
graces with harmonies thrown in the midst; an employment
hitherto unknown of the interval of the tenth to increase the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
fulness of tone-colour; a regardless interweaving of highest and
lowest notes for purposes of light and shade; the most manifold
application of the tone-colours of different octaves for the coloration
of the tone-effect; the entirely naturalistic use of the tremolo
and the glissando; and above all a perfect systematization of the
method of interlacing the hands, partly for the management of
runs so as to bring out the colour, partly to gain a doubled power
by the division, and partly to attain, by the use of contractions
and extensions in the figures, a fulness of orchestral chord-power
never hitherto practised. This is the last step possible
for the piano in the process of individualisation begun by Hummel
and continued by Chopin. The three systems of notes, instead
of two, appear more frequently; in fact the two hands appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
for the most part to play a group of notes which seem to be
conceived for three. And precisely by this means the two hands
run inside and through one another, as if they were only a single
tool of ten fingers. The music appears again to become a corporate
unity of tone, as it had already once been in its first
beginnings. But, it has now become, out of a universal music,
a music for the piano. An historic mission is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Liszt invents a fingering for his purposes which has no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
principle than that of the most absolute opportunism. Scales,
struck by one finger, trills played with changing fingers, strenuous
parallel octave passages, heavy fingering in order to drag
out parts which otherwise glide too lightly—everywhere, in place
of the academic rule, there is an attempt to grasp the effect of
the moment, a moulding after the impulses of the expression.
And thence arises a soul-giving power even down to the most
trifling passing-note, until the man and the playing are one.
Liszt did the miracles of a prophet in his recitals, tumultuous
assemblies, in which it actually happened that the people did
not stir from the place till one o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>So early as 1839 he was able to venture on the first pure
piano-recital ever given, after Moscheles had paved the way
with his mixed piano-recital without orchestra. Not only could
he fill up a whole evening with performances on this instrument
alone; he was able to fill with his performances twenty-one
evenings in the short space between December 27, 1841, and
March 2, 1842. This was the brilliant period of his virtuoso-years;
twenty-one recitals in Berlin within this short space! In
the history of piano-playing they are festival weeks, holy days,
in which by the greatest of all pianists a world-literature was
made living on the keys, so that all Europe resounded. At
that time we hear of a critic wondering how this marvellous
man could actually improvise along with an orchestra! So little
were people accustomed to playing by heart, which since Liszt’s
time has become the universal rule.</p>

<p>Liszt’s innumerable compositions for the piano, which were
first completely named in Ramann’s book, remind us again of
the three types of artists of which we spoke above. We find in
them Liszt the compiler, who makes use of the experiences of
centuries; and we find Liszt the innovator, who points out new
ways in motives which we might think were only seen in Wagner,
in naturalisms which developed music, and in technical means
of expression; but we do not find in him a composer of genius,
who can hardly hold himself back from his inspirations, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
with unforced ease, creates new forms for the new ideas. We
shall, as time advances, suffer less and less from illusions on this
point. And Liszt himself was content to be an innovator without
being a creator. He was a clever artist who knew his own limitations
accurately. He invents a theme which is spirited, new, and
characteristic; and when he has invented the theme he sits down
and arranges it according to all the powers of technical expression;
and varies it in forms whose technique is their content, so
that technique and content become identical. This is the last
effect of the Étude-principle, in which an idea finds, not its form,
but its technical expression.</p>

<p>This special method of Liszt is preserved at its best in the
twenty Rhapsodies. The Magyar <cite>Dallok</cite> had appeared already
as studies. But these Rhapsodies far surpass them in polish.
Hungarian national airs, with their rushing rhythmical and unrhythmical
<i lang="fr">verve</i>, were here for the first time taken up into the
circle of art, and supplied the motives from which he poured
forth a pyrotechnic display of brilliant variations, whose technique
has not a single useless note, and whose working-out is indescribably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
delicate and harmonically
interesting. <abbr title="Numbers">Nos.</abbr> 2, 6, 9 (Pester
Karneval), 12 (to Joachim), and
14 (to Bülow), are not unjustly
preferred to the rest. No 14,
with its astounding development
from the funeral march to the
joyous stretto, has remained one
of the most marvellous piano-pieces
on record. In it an unparalleled
technique is revealed,
while the piece is not thereby
rendered hollow or superfluous.</p>

<p>The charming Spanish
Rhapsody, the Chopin-like
“Consolations,” the wonderfully
impromptu-like “Apparitions”
and “Harmonies Poétiques et
Religieuses,” that grand congeries
of various differently arranged and differently put together
Études and drawing-room pieces, the “Années de Pélerinage”
(three volumes) with the Tarantelle, the Paganini Études with the
Campanella, further collections of Études till we reach the Twelve
Études d’exécution transcendente, the “Dream Nocturnes,” the
“Mephisto Waltzes and Polkas,” the “Caprice Valses,” the
“Chromatic Galop”—I will only refer to a few pieces which
possess a special historic or artistic interest. In 1834, as his first
romantic production, appeared the “Pensée des Morts,” in mixed
time, <i lang="it">senza tempo</i>, with mottos from Lamartine, for whom, with
Chateaubriand, he felt the highest literary admiration. In the
same year came out “Lyon,” a realistic piece on the uprising of
the Lyons working-classes, and one of the few piano-compositions
relating to contemporary events. “Sposalizio” and “Il Penseroso”
(1838, 1839) are notable as pieces inspired by the impressions of
the representative arts, as the somewhat feeble “Fantasia quasi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Sonata” (1837) arose from the perusal of Dante. The whole of
these are romantic confessions in which the arts greet each other in
friendly wise. In importance, however, they are far surpassed by
the later piano works; above all by the five best original pieces,
the Legends, the Concertos, and the B minor Sonata.</p>

<p>The Legends of 1866 are in honour of his patron saint, St
Francis. The first shews him in an ecclesiastical theme, sweeping
over the waves, which are represented by the usual variation. In
the other he is preaching to the birds. It is a wonderful free
impromptu, in which a church air is set over against the twitter of
the birds, which is marked by masterly technique. The birds
seem to be listening to the saint; their twittering seems likely to
give way to his pious harmonies; but at the conclusion we see
them again in a cheerfulness which leads on to a ravishing cry of
birds. It is the most poetical piece that Liszt ever wrote for the
piano.</p>

<p>The Sonata in B minor (1854) dedicated to Schumann, has one
movement but many themes. Six motives of varied colouring are
knitted into one web, which unfolds itself into a splendid picture.
A royal brilliancy lies over the whole. More free and lively are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
the two single-movement Concertos. The one in A major has its
characteristic line C sharp B C B, which is to be followed out into
the cadenzas; a main theme with all kinds of subordinate themes,
in a natural threefold quickening from slower reflective sections.
The E flat major is constructed on the opposite model—its
characteristic line is E flat, D, E flat; D E flat, D, D flat. This
work is probably the most frequently heard of Liszt’s concerted
pieces. It is more <i lang="it">giusto</i> in essence, with slower by-themes—especially
the beautiful Adagio with the Tristan-like motive and
the Pastorale middle-section—swinging up in Bacchic style. On
the return to the main theme all the motives alter into a more
cheerful strain; the adagio gives way to a martial movement, and
the Pastorale is taken up by the piano with increased ornamentation.
In the place of the old formal scheme a psychological
process had entered; an inward conversation of the piano with
the orchestra and its instruments.</p>

<p>From the point of view of number, still greater than the
original pieces are the arrangements, which embrace a whole
world, from variations to complete transformations of themes,
from the “Dance of the Dead” on the Cantus of the Dies Irae
to the Rhapsodies, from his arrangements of Bach to his Paraphrases
of Wagner, from the innumerable songs and waltzes of
Schubert to the settings of Beethoven’s symphonies, and the
symphonic poems of Liszt’s own. Here was a huge mass of
material, which was transmitted spiritually and artistically to
the public by means of the piano. And in the hither and
thither of the arrangements we trace the most labyrinthine paths.
Schubert’s Marches, for example, were first transcribed for four
hands, then arranged for orchestra, and finally re-transcribed from
the orchestral setting for the pianoforte. Liszt’s arrangements are
no mere transcriptions; they are poetical re-settings, seen through
the medium of the piano. He assimilates the composition before
him into himself, and reproduces it on the piano as if he had
conceived it, with all its special peculiarities, for the piano alone.
Such things seemed often to be the very best expression of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
genius. This great series begins with the transcriptions of
Paganini’s Capriccios, and that of the “Symphonie fantastique”
of Berlioz; and it reaches its height in the two-handed settings
of Beethoven’s symphonies. The pieces have become genuine
piano-compositions, in which a full score is reproduced by specific
fulness of chord, and a sweeping chord by broken harmonies
sustained by the pedal. The piano is no longer merely one pillar
of the musical structure; it has become the architect of an art of
its own. This art of its own becomes yet more visible when it
deals, not with the transcription of ready-made works, but with
paraphrases of given sections, which were to be released from their
surroundings. Liszt made many operatic fantasias of this kind,
and did not always utterly oppose the taste of the time, which did
not object to dissolve a characteristic melody into flourishes, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
make a sad and trembling motive
tower into unexpected heights. Of
this his Tannhäuser March and his
Don Giovanni Fantasia are proofs.
But the rule, nevertheless, is that he
never undertakes anything contrary
to the character of the passage to
be paraphrased, and that—as he
does most successfully in the Rienzi
Fantasia—he does not overlay the
melody with cadenzas and ornamentations
from without, but extracts
them, as it were, from the
substance of the piece itself.</p>

<p>Only those parts of the opera
does he bind together in his paraphrase,
which stand in an inward relation to each other. It
is now entirely drawn from a leading idea, and is related to the

poem to the symphony.</p>

<p>The immense difficulties of Liszt’s compositions retarded their
popularity for many years. Clara
Schumann and Sophie Menter were
amongst the first brave performers
to introduce them into their repertoires.
To-day they almost overburden
the recitals, and include
much of little value, which would
hardly survive except as the <i lang="la">disjecta

of a kind never seen before. He
created a type of recital in which
his imitators often copy the Master
down to his very hair. His missionaries
travelled over the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
world from the circle which
he gathered round himself
at Weimar in the summer
months. Their ideal is
his creation; the perfect,
memoriter, technically and
stylistically adjusted mastery
of the great and
many-sided piano literature,
without regard for
century or nation.</p>

<p>Liszt’s contemporaries
in piano-virtuosity are
almost forgotten. Their
name vanishes like a
dream. Others succeed in
their place; generations
press eagerly on each other’s heels. There was the wild and
headstrong Mortier de Fontaine, who was the first to venture
on playing Beethoven’s <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 106
in public. Döhler, Dreyschock,
Rosenhain, Jaell and his wife,
Wilhelmina Clauss-Savardy,
Sophie Menter, like her in
objectivity, the more vigorous
Annette Essipoff, afterwards
the wife of Leschetizki, who
now holds the very centre of
piano-teaching in Vienna. In
our time are Madame Carreño,
so masculine in her convincing
interpretations, and Clotilde
Kleeberg, her opposite, so sympathetic
and delicate, the truly
womanly executant of Schumann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
and Chopin. Madame Essipoff was a pupil of Anton
Rubinstein, from whom a by-stream ran out alongside of the
world-embracing school of Liszt. Rubinstein’s and Bülow’s playing
represented the difference which was bound to arise between
the classical and the spiritual interpretation of piano-works. Rubinstein
was the great subjective artist, who gave way entirely to the
mood of the moment, and could rush on in an instant in such a
way as to leave no room for the cool criticism of a later hour. But
Bülow was the great objective artist, the teacher and unfolder
of all mysteries, the unraveller of the knottiest points in Beethoven’s
latest works, which he understood to their innermost
details. In his playing the intellect had the gratification of
clear-cut sharpness, while the heart retained the emotion long
after the artist left the platform. Both artists were in their
kind finished and complete, and both were of incalculable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
influence on whole generations. The impressionist Rubinstein
and the draughtsman Bülow had each the technique which
suited him. The one rushed and raved, and a slight want
of polish was the natural result of his impressionist temperament;
the other drew carefully the threads from the keys,
occasionally showing them with a smile to his audience, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
every tone and every tempo stood in ironbound firmness, and
every line was there before it was drawn.</p>

<p>Rubinstein and Bülow were both interpretative natures.
Rubinstein composed much, Bülow little; and Rubinstein’s
compositions are hollow while Bülow’s are fragmentary. In
their compositions the two men are at their worst; the pathos
of Rubinstein became maudlin, and the severity of Bülow became
simple harshness. The best that Bülow ever wrote for the piano
was the piano-arrangement of Tristan, which is unparalleled in its
expression of pain; but his best work of all was his annotations
to Beethoven’s Sonatas and Variations. Rubinstein’s innumerable
Dances and National Airs are played indeed, but they are practically
forgotten; his Tarantelles, Serenades, Sonatas, Concertos,
get nearer to sinking every year. Rubinstein’s experiences, his
activity in St Petersburg, his final stay in a pension at Dresden,
were rather external than internal changes. Later in his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
he was able to spend more money
on his gigantic plans. In a cycle of
seven piano-recitals he undertook to
give a complete picture of the historical
development of his art. It is
well known with what self-sacrifice
he gave these recitals, and how
nobly he followed the unique principle
which great virtuosos should
set before themselves, namely that
those who have should pay for the
art, in order that those who have
not should receive it gratuitously.
Bülow’s experiences, on the other
hand, were internal. His change
from Wagner to Brahms will be regarded
by every student of great
souls, not as a desertion of his colours, but as a mental phenomenon.
In Bülow’s nature there was at bottom nothing in
common with Wagner; and it may well be that he never saw
Wagner except through the glasses of the concert, of execution,
of display, not of the stage, or of sensuous perception.
Bülow was not stage-bitten, nor was he even a man with a
head full of the philosophy of the stage; he was a downright
worker, a teacher, to whom indeed teaching came so natural that
he for a considerable time gave lessons with Raff in Frankfort
and Klindworth in Berlin. When he gave public recitals he
did not, like Rubinstein, crowd a history of the piano into a few
evenings. He took by preference a single author, like Beethoven,
and played only the five last Sonatas, or he unfolded the whole
of Beethoven historically in four evenings. He would have
preferred to play every piece twice. Great draughtsman as he
was, he hated all half-lights and colourations; he pointed his
pencil very finely, and his paper was very white. If he laid
his pencil down, it was only for a short time; and if he played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
any work, the composer was a made man. Over the variations
of Tschaïkowski could be read, “Joué par M. Bülow dans ses
concerts.”</p>

<p>Teacher and virtuoso—these mark great pianists into two
groups, or at least into two temperaments; and it was this marked
difference which was signalised by the appearance of Bülow and
of Rubinstein. In all, the severance is perfected according to the
natural aptitude and inner development. Of course over every
virtuoso at a certain time there comes the wish to busy himself
with teaching, but only in a small circle; but on the other hand
we observe that the decision to follow the teaching profession is
instantly taken by those artists who have no turn for publicity,
or do not like to face the competition which to-day is more keen
than ever. The extreme of the virtuoso type is seen in certain
international geniuses, who continued rather the tradition of
Thalberg than that of Liszt. Thalberg, in the fifties, like Henri
Herz in the forties, toured in America and Brazil. Rubinstein
also, in the sixties, visited America. The most travelled of all
was the Irish pianist and composer Wallace, who, for the sake
of his health, toured and gave concerts through Australia, New
Zealand, India, South America, the
United States and Mexico—long
before Thalberg’s Brazilian journey.
To-day a tour in America is almost
a matter of course in the life of every
virtuoso. Countries like France and
Italy are shut off from a great international
intercourse of this kind, since
their concert-life, and especially their
cultivation of the piano, has never
duly unfolded itself. The opera is
there all powerful. But England, as
a hundred years ago, invites to her
shores the great men of the Continent,
and sends them back loaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
with treasures. As London pianists
Hartvigson, the pupil of
Bülow, Borwick, and Dawson,
stand in the front rank. Russia,
formerly a colony of foreign
emigrants, has now, by Anton
Rubinstein’s foundations in St
Petersburg, and by the like activity
of his highly-esteemed
brother Nicholas in Moscow,
awaked to a noble concert-life,
in which the rivalry of the two
capitals is remarkably balanced.
It was inevitable that in nearer
and further states ever more
numerous pupils of German or
Parisian masters should settle and labour as teachers. In
America, so early as the sixties and seventies, a great number
of naturalised teachers was known, among whom Wolfsohn is
perhaps most distinguished. His eighteen evenings of historically
arranged piano-music, which he gave so early as 1877 in Chicago,
are deservedly famous.</p>

<p>Tausig, the pupil of Liszt, who by his brilliant technique
and his extraordinary sense for style was the wonder of his
contemporaries, left behind him various good arrangements and
compositions perhaps too obvious in their virtuosity. He was
born in Warsaw and died at thirty. He would have meant to
our time a teaching power of the first magnitude. The crown
of piano-playing in our time has been won by Eugene d’Albert,
born in 1864, a small man with giant power, a loveable person
of astonishing artistic seriousness. He was a pupil of Liszt,
and on him the mantle of Liszt has fallen in our generation.
His greatest virtue is his classic temperament. In his memory
rest safely stored the greatest works from Bach to Tausig. If
he takes one out, he takes with it the sphere in which it stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
unspoilt—the style of its execution. The piece stands fast in
its construction; not a phrase appears inorganic, not a rhythm
accidental. The seriousness of Brahms’s Concertos, the murmuring
of Chopin’s Berceuse, the Titanic power of his A minor
Étude, the grace of Liszt’s Soirées de Vienne, the solemnity of
Bach, move under his hand in the concert, without one taking
the least from another. It is objectivity, but we do not cry
out for subjectivity; it is personality, but we do not miss the

<p>Liszt’s pupils Reisenauer and Stavenhagen endeavoured on a
similar ground to play a part as more general interpreters. But
chance and change played them many tricks. Others, again, had
and have their special excellencies. Paderewski, idolised in
England and America, is the delicate, emotional, drawing-room
player; Sauer, the bravura pianist; Siloti, the interpreter of
Russian piano-music; Friedheim, the Liszt-player; Karl Heymann,
the graceful. Barth, the pupil of Bülow, is severe; Rosenthal,
an amazing technician; Ansorge, one of the most intellectual;
Gabrilowitsch, who drives the horses of Rubinstein; Vladimir von
Pachmann, with all his extravagancy, at least plays Chopin’s
Mazurkas with absolute faithfulness
to their national character;
Busoni shows great passion;
Lütschg has an extraordinarily
strong wrist; the miraculous
child Paula Szalit transposes
fugues on the spot; Josef Hofmann,
once an “infant prodigy,”
is now an astonishingly
individualistic artist; and
Eduard Risler has an inimitable
soft touch. Since the
triumphs of Planté, indeed,
Risler is the first French pianist
to achieve a universal renown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
He is a pupil of the eminent
Parisian master Diémer. He
has discovered those last delicate
<i lang="fr">nuances</i> which lie precisely between
tone and silence. His tones seem
not to begin and not to cease;
they are woven out of ethereal
gossamer. While d’Albert plays
with the whole upper body, seeks
the keys and rivets them fast,
breaks the sforzatos, and soothes
the pianissimos; Risler is a statue
at the piano, externally a Stoic; but
his gliding and crossing fingers, so
soon as they have struck the first
chord, become the most sensitive agents of an emotional soul. Under
Risler’s treatment the commonplace becomes a novelty. Out of
Liszt’s sermon of St Francis to the birds he draws the last poetical
breath; Beethoven he bathes in a warm brilliancy of his own; and,
not to be charged with too much sweetness, he flings himself loose
with the overture to the Meistersinger, so that we fancy the whole
orchestra to be playing, and we have an assurance that it is not
weakness, but an active artistic restraint which gives to his touch
its never-to-be-forgotten delicate profundity.</p>

<p>Piano-playing, in such an unparalleled advance, became of
necessity a profession, which at one time enticed to deceive, at
another rewarded abundantly. It is a profession which on one
side leads to royal wealth, on the other to that extreme of misery
which is the half of all art. The collision, which in our age is
inevitable between industry and art, revealed the terrible abysses
which yawn between the claims of a profession and those of art.
While in a Frankfort paper we can read advertisements in which
a young lady teacher offers two piano lessons a week in return for
the daily four o’clock coffee with the family, young Hofmann, at
nine years of age, gave, in New York alone, within three months,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
thirty-five recitals, from which his impresario, out of a gross
receipt of over twenty-five thousand pounds, took at least ten
thousand for himself.</p>

<p>The piano has become an essential part of life. Those who
cannot play it stand outside a great company which cultivates it
as an engine of social and home intercourse. In households
where there is no piano we seem to breathe a foreign atmosphere.
To-day we need no longer explain the piano from the church or
the theatre, from the ballet or the volkslied, from the artistic
song or the violin; it has on the contrary become an active
centre, which has given its form to our whole musical culture;
nay, more, which has even given the stamp to our whole conception
of music, not only in the minds of all amateurs, but in
the minds of many professionals. Whether the young girl spends
her time with Chopin’s E flat major Nocturne, or whether a false
sentiment attaches itself to the “Maiden’s Prayer” or the
“Cloister Bell”; whether the waltzes of Lanner delight a quiet
mind or Strauss calls to the dance; whether the eager pupil plies
her healthy sport in Cramer’s, Schmitt’s, or Czerny’s Studies, or
the rising virtuoso exercises himself mechanically in scales after
d’Albert’s fashion, while he simultaneously reads new notes, or as
Henselt plays Bach while he reads his Bible; whether amateurs
enjoy themselves with the piano-abstracts
of operatic fragments; or
whether artists like the Kapellmeisters
Fischer and Sucher, offer those
Fantasias from Wagner over which
they have spent their lives; whether
the professor allows himself the enjoyment
of private piano-literature,
or performs standard works before
thousands in the concert hall;—all
these are accidents of culture, they
are phenomena which offer a picture
of that intimate interdependence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
music and actual life which has developed so fruitfully since
the art ceased to be the private possession of a clique, and
which has established it on an absolutely new foundation. Of
course, the more general piano culture has become, the more has
it been in turn used up as a profession, and the more easily
were its wings fettered. Our chief men also have ceased to improvise
during a recital. Only our “comic artists” do so at the
present day. And of a power of magical improvisation, exercised
in private such as Beethoven and Liszt so often displayed, we
now hear less and less. The recitals, in great part, deal with the
interpretation of known works, which often—like Beethoven’s E
flat major concerto—are repeated <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>. We have learning,
we have playing, but we never see the enthusiasm which can be
evoked by the stress of immediate creation. Piano-playing is a
universal business even to the extremest limits of an amateurism
which cannot strike a single chord instantaneously, nor dot a
single note correctly. It is a long line from the little yawning
schoolgirl, through the teacher running up and down stairs, to
the virtuosos who play in the winter and give instruction in the
summer. With excess of zeal comes sin. Nowhere in an art is
a sin so often committed as in the choice of masters popular
to-day. From false economy, musical culture, which is so profound
and so difficult, is intrusted to the most incompetent, and
fortunes are squandered in ruining the music in a child. In a
paper once was to be read a somewhat humorous satire, entitled,
“Directions for use,” in which the teachers were thus handled:
“For beginners the choice of a master is recommended—there
are masters at all prices—very good lessons can be had for sixpence;
but masters with long hair charge three shillings and
upwards—for male adults the choice of a mistress is recommended,
because pleasure and love are thus excited together.”</p>

<p>In order to put a check on amateur teaching a movement has
of late years been set on foot to forbid untried teachers to occupy
any position. As yet, however, the movement wants legal enforcement.
Kullack and Klauwell in Cologne, Breslaur in Berlin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
publisher of the <cite>Piano-teacher</cite> (a
paper now twenty-one years old),
have founded seminaries for intending
teachers. In 1896, in Cologne,
out of four hundred students only
thirty received a diploma of teaching
capacity—but no means at present
exists of forbidding the others to
teach. Consider the enormous crowds
that pass out of our music-schools.
An infinitesimal proportion may perhaps
decide for a virtuoso career.
Of the rest half remain amateur,
the other half go in to the teaching
profession. The overcrowding may
easily be imagined. The largest music-school in the world, the
English “Guildhall School” of Music, had till lately 140 professors,
42 teaching-rooms, 2700 students; and will shortly be
enlarged till it has 69 rooms and 5000 students. I have made
special inquiries at the Berlin Conservatorium of Klindworth and
Scharwenka. My numbers are I think exact to a few figures. In
1895-6, out of 387 students, 41 men and 208 women took piano
only; 8 men and 15 women took piano with some other subject.
In 1896-7, out of 383 pupils, 40 men and 239 women learnt piano
alone, and 4 men and 8 women learnt piano with something else.
Of these 247 women, besides, about 43 are English or Americans.
Since on the average we reckon two years for a course, there go
from this school alone, every year, more than fifty women-teachers
into the world. Some of them perhaps may win a doubtful testimonial
in a dearly-bought Berlin concert; others, who aimed at
virtuosity, may, after a pitiful experience, themselves sink into
teachers. Of the frequency of piano-performances in concerts
the following figures may give some notion. I have counted the
more important Berlin concerts in nine weeks taken at random—159
in all. Among them are 58 piano-concerts, partly combined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
with performances on other instruments, partly interesting through
the personality of the pianist; mere accompanying of songs being
of course not reckoned.</p>

<p>The number of music-schools has increased specially in the
capital cities. In France the Parisian High School has a great
repute; in Russia the Moscow and St Petersburg Conservatoriums;
in Belgium the Brussels Conservatoire, under the guidance of
Dupont, who is also distinguished as the editor of old piano-works;
in London the Royal Academy of Music [and the Royal
College of Music]. In Germany we have in Frankfort the Hoch
Conservatorium under Bernhard Scholz, and the Raff under Max
Schwarz; Stuttgart has somewhat declined through the deaths
of Lebert and Starck, the editors of the great Theoretical and
Practical School; but Cologne has greatly gained in importance
under Wüllner. In Leipzig under Mendelssohn, Moscheles and
Plaidy, piano-playing took the first place; new technical devices
like the pedal-clavier—that is, with organ pedals for the low notes—were
freely admitted, as in our days the Janko-keyboard. But
with the inevitable reaction, this school has decayed, and its
importance in piano-art is not what it was. In Berlin the Royal
“Hochschule” with Barth, Raif, Rudorff, and others, at its head,
experienced a like fate. Private institutions have come to the
front. Tausig’s School for higher piano-playing (1866-1870), was
very distinguished. From it went Joseffy to New York and
Robert Freund to Zürich. The New Academy, founded by
Theodor Kullak, was also famous. It was afterwards replaced
by another Institute founded by his son. The Stern Conservatorium,
now directed by Gustav Holländer along with Jedliczka;
the Klindworth, at which for a time Bülow and Moszkowski
laboured; and that of Scharwenka, which, after Xaver Scharwenka’s
departure for America, was for a time united with the
Klindworth;—are known to all.</p>

<p>Like the practical “schools,” the theoretical have also become
innumerable. I take as a few of the most important works the
following: Adolph Kullak’s “Aesthetic of Piano-playing,” re-edited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
by Bischoff, a unique and profound work on the theory of
the art, as a hundred years’ experience and the careful observations
of the author have enlarged it; Hugo Riemann’s “Comparative
Theoretical and Practical Piano School, presenting system, method,
and materials, in a historic and organic connection”; and, among
the innumerable “schools” and volumes of exercises, the various
thoughtful works of Germer. Two main principles have come to
occupy the first place in the newest school-practice. First, the
systematic carrying out—not merely of a musical mechanic of the
hand, but its thorough gymnastic. This was the natural advance,
which carried yet further the teaching of Czerny. The hand is
adapted for piano-playing—as in the systems of Thilo, Virgil, and
others—by gymnastics of the fingers, and stretching of the
muscles. Thus a great part of the gymnastic cultivation is got
over before actual musical practice begins. In this work the dumb
keyboards, which to-day are constructed with great delicacy, have
borne a great part. They now admit of legato playing and of
different degrees of strength in touch.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <a id="i_307"></a>
 <img src="images/i_307.jpg"
 alt="Hand of Eugene d’Albert">
 <p class="caption">Hand of Eugene d’Albert. Röntgen ray photograph by Spies.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The second great principle is to take into account in instruction
the peculiarities of the pupil’s hand. It stands to reason that the
same exercises will not do for all hands. One hand demands this,
the other that. This method is carried out with the utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
precision by the greatest of teachers, Leschetizky. A similar
principle prevails in modern teaching of singing. We no longer
endeavour to base voice-cultivation on the universal vowel A, but
on that vowel which comes most natural to the organ of the
pupil.</p>

<p class="p2">The arrangement of the keys is the sacred tradition of
centuries. It presents the tone-system, as it were, lengthways,
and is the natural expression of a melodic musical concept. The
separation of the black and the white keys has been introduced in
accordance with a certain theoretical principle, which allows the
difference of position in our scales over the black and white keys
to appear somewhat complicated. Our keyboards are constructed
entirely on the C major scale; the tones outside this scale are
thrown into the black keys, and thus appear in a subordinate
position: thus all other scales have a strange form and often a
somewhat difficult fingering. But since the seventeenth century
our conception of music has gradually, from melodic, become
harmonic; we hear vertically as well as horizontally; we hear the
beauty of all chords as sounded together, and, unconsciously, we
fill in the harmonies to every melody we hear. It would have
been natural if the keyed instruments had adapted themselves to
this altered musical conception, and had resigned the original
conception of the scale to make way for harmonic conveniences.
Nothing, however, is slower to be reached than the determination
to revolutionise from the foundation a technique adopted in the
schools, since no one is willing to make the sudden break with the
old and the sudden start with the new.</p>

<p>Attempts had already been made to break the monopoly of
the C major scale, and to form a regular chromatic scale of twelve
similar keys. In our own day Paul von Janko has improved this
system by repeating every regular chromatic series three times in
terrace-style one above another, so that not only wider stretches,
but also, without much movement of the hand, a surprising control
of full chords and of rapid passages is attained. The tones are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
thus brought more narrowly together as the monopoly of the C
major key is destroyed; and the result betokens a decisive advance
in the conception of modern music. This conception still embodies
a compromise between the old scale-keyboard and an
arrangement of the keys, which, founded on harmonic ideas, has
promise for the future. Janko’s keyboard is slowly gaining
converts. Great houses, like those of Ibach, Duysen, Kaps, and
Blüthner, are taking it up. Hausmann in Berlin, and Wendling in
Leipzig, are the chief supporters of the scheme. In America we
hear stories of remarkable results. Only by the development of
such a new keyboard, which will have to answer the demands of
the modern conception of music, will it be possible to draw new
tone-effects from the piano. Its utmost capacities, in its present
form, have been exhausted, it would seem, by Liszt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the construction of the instruments has advanced
to an unexampled perfection. It is only a hundred years since
Stein began his laborious attempts on the new pianoforte. To-day
a network of factories is spread over the whole world, in which
innumerable faultless instruments are made, which put to use
all the results of experience in the treatment of wood and wires.
The modern pianos have already attained so completely the ideal
of the hammer-mechanism that we are beginning to hark back
to the forgotten tones of the cembalo. In Paris these aims have
their strongest support in Diémer, who plays his Couperin on
clavecins, and at the same time wins new renown for the oboe
d’amour and the viol da gamba in the chamber-concert. Already
quill-claviers are being more frequently constructed, and the
reaction against the predominance of the pianoforte finds its
satisfaction in their sweet and thrilling sounds.</p>

<p>It is impossible to review all the piano-factories of both
hemispheres, or to register all their innovations. I must content
myself with mentioning the system of “overstringing,” invented
simultaneously by several persons; the felting of the hammers,
introduced by Pape; the third pedal of Steinway which holds
on single tones without affecting the others; the use of a cast-iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
frame and of cast-steel strings; and the vertical stringing of the
upright “cottage” piano, which is developed out of older forms.
Bechstein’s factory in Berlin stands at the head of German
manufacture; but there are also Duysen, Blüthner, Schiedmayer,
Irmler, Westermayer, Kaps, Ibach, and innumerable others;
Bösendorfer in Vienna, Knabe in Baltimore, and Steinway in
New York, who have succeeded to the renown of Chickering;
besides the many other older-established firms. Bechstein, so
fundamentally sound; and Steinway, with his patent fulness of
tone, are the two rivals for the laurel at the end of the century.</p>

<p>Henry Engelhard Steinway, born in Brunswick, began, in the
fifties, his New York business in very small circumstances. A
three-storied house was the factory, and one piano a week was
the output. In 1859, however, the firm was in a position to
build a great establishment, which now, after several enlargements,
covers more than four acres. The output advanced with
giant strides: numerous patents were taken out for the improvement
of the resonance and the fulness of tone: in 1872 the
Emperor Alexander bought the twenty-five thousandth piano,
and in 1883 Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild of Vienna bought
the fifty thousandth. Besides the factory, the firm possesses in
Astoria great estates, the timber of which covers not less than
a hundred and fifty acres. There they have their yards, saw-mills,
turning-mills, foundries, metal-workshops, and mechanical wood-bending
and carving apparatus. The parts are sent from Astoria
to New York to be fitted together. When completed, the pianos
are exhibited in Steinway Hall (14th Street) with a view to sale.
More than ninety thousand have been completed up to date, of
which a large proportion has been transmitted to Europe through
the London and Hamburg branches.</p>

<p>Bechstein has adopted a similar division of his work. He
has two factories, the one in the suburbs, for the preparation of
the parts and the drying of the wood, the other in the town for
the fitting together of the pieces. This latter is in close connection
with the shop. Karl Bechstein, like Steinway, began in the fifties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
on a very small scale, and in 1860 founded his great house in
Johannisstrasse. In 1880 he acquired the first portion of the
suburban estate, on which to-day four factories stand. The
victorious brilliancy of modern ingenuity is to be seen in the
whole establishment. The probation through which the wood
has to pass in the yards, then in the dry-rooms, in the store-cellars,
and finally when sized in the store-houses of the factories, before
it can be used, is a grand guarantee of its suitability. Two
important rooms are devoted to steam-power. The one is the
planing-room, where sides and lid are planed together by machines
of such extraordinary power that the shavings hum about under
centrifugal force, and are carried off by an exhaust apparatus.
The other is the foundry, where all the metal work is carried on,
from the boring of the cast frame to the preparation of the screws.
Next, in the upper storeys, in the more distant factories, begins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the process of fitting the piano together from the rough parts.
The action is provided by a separate factory, the Nürnberg wires
are spun, the walls of the grand pianos are glued together
in from twelve to twenty thicknesses, the frame is bronzed, the
wood inlaid, the ornaments put on, every tiny screw, every spindle
is touched up with rare attention, till the instrument gains its
speech, and is tested, for the last refinements, in separate rooms.
Since the completion of the last building, they reckon on a yearly
output of not less than three thousand five hundred pianos, on
which eight hundred workers are employed. The proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
grands to cottages is as three to four, a proof of the enormous
popularity of the cottage, for which as a piece of furniture it is
so easy to find room, but which, even in its best specimens, can
never give to the musician the fulness of tone and the resonance
of a grand. The demand for Bechsteins is greater than their
factories can meet. It is remarkable that half of them go to
England and the English colonies through the London branches;
while Germany, Austria, Russia, Italy, Spain, and South America,
share the other half. In a business of such magnitude it is no
mere ostentation to record these figures, which simply supply the
necessary statistics of the general trade.</p>

<p>So long as the piano was merely an instrument for more or less
gifted musicians, it was unnecessary to consider the question which
to-day, when it has become a general means of social pleasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
stands in the foreground—namely its treatment as a piece of
furniture. The “square” instrument has only certain parts, particularly
the lower extremities, in which the style of the time
could be expressed. The legs and the feet were, in the time of
the Ruckers, <i lang="fr">baroque</i>; as in the time of the Streichers they
adopted the style of the Empire, and in our day that of the
Renaissance. The rest of the body was fixed in its main lines
by the given natural forms; and has altered very little in architectural
relations in the course of centuries. The piano was in
the fortunate position, even in the times when as yet little attention
was paid to constructive logic, of being a construction, which,
from its very aim, gained the most beautiful form. With its
gracefully-bending walls, and its natural and yet characteristic
shape, the grand piano, in many furnishing schemes of the insipid
fifties or the glaring eighties, in many a jerry-built and cheaply
appointed house, stood as the single solid and carefully wrought
article in the place. The cottage, on the other hand, which too
often is meant to be nothing but a piece of furniture, and which
with its encasing wood-walls offers only too much opportunity
to fashionable taste, has sunk deep into the domestic style, and
even to-day has hardly freed itself from these false influences.
It would seem that the cottage piano was invented in 1739 by
the priest Don Domenico of Mela in Gagliano. Only at the
commencement of this century did it begin to spread on this
side of the Alps. It offered a grand field for dubious artistic
experiments. Now it was treated merely as a sideboard, now
as an Egyptian pyramid, now as an altar with figurative paintings,
now as the <i lang="la">corpus vile</i> for all kinds of marqueterie-experiments.
I know only one cottage piano that expresses its essence in
characteristic style, and develops its form without grimaces: this
is the “English” type, plain and unadorned, introduced into the
trade by Bechstein, a principal feature of which is that the legs
are continued above the keyboard in a very graceful style, as
candle-brackets.</p>

<p>When the grand piano is used as an object for decoration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
the result is usually unsatisfactory. The contradiction between
its plain form and gaudy ornamentation becomes very marked.
Earlier ages saw clearly that the walls of the piano and its lid
are best left plain, and adorned with paintings. But to-day the
cases are more frequent in which specially magnificent pianos
are so carefully fitted up with plastic ornamentation in all styles
with pillars, reliefs, and other descriptions of carving, that one
can only smile at the waste of labour. In the over-rich rococo
adornment, which was presented by a piano built by Bechstein
some time ago for the Empress Frederick for a particular apartment,
a trained eye can to-day find no pleasure. More tolerable
are the splendid grands, richly adorned with paintings, in which,
in Germany, Max Koch is chiefly concerned. The Wagner piano
for the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, or the Rheingold piano, both by
Bechstein, are also worth noticing. The latter has the daughters
of the Rhine for legs, a waving ornamentation on the walls, and
carved bulrushes on the lid; it is one of the most interesting
monster-pianos built in our time. In England Alma Tadema
is the piano-painter most in request. For Henry Marquand of
New York he prepared an instrument, adorned with precious
stones and with painting, which was priced at £15,000. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
own piano is also extraordinary. The ornamentation chosen is
in the style of mediæval mosaics, with expensive surface ornamentations.
Under the lid are framed and adorned parchment
strips, on which Liszt, Tschaïkowski, Gounod, and others, inscribed
their names. This was appraised at £2500. A piano built in
London for Carmen Sylva had ivory legs. Perhaps a varied
ebony and ivory ornamentation, which springs from the appearance
of the keys, taking advantage of the splendid surface provided
by these materials, would be more promising than any
kind of rococo or Gothic design. Ivory is still in strong demand
for pianos. Ninety thousand instruments are yearly issued from
the hundred and seventy London houses; and these take ten
thousand tusks.</p>

<p>Ever since composers began to write easier pieces the demand
for pianos has been greater. The market has of course been well
supplied. In 1896 appeared over 2500 “books”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of piano solos,
2000 songs with piano accompaniment, more than 250 books of
duets, and 300 pieces for piano and violin. Among these figure
many new editions of old works, which to-day form a literature
by themselves. The arrangement of historical material, as it gives
its character to the calling of the modern pianist, is also reflected
in it. We have excellent editions, like the Berlin “Original Texts”
(Urtexte), “Bischoff’s Bach,” published by Steingräber, “Klindworth’s
Chopin,” published by Bote and Bock, “Bischoff and
Neitzel’s Schumann,” “Bülow’s Beethoven’s Sonatas.” Breitkopf
and Härtel have extended their Popular Library over the widest
area. They have arranged their piano-publications into a uniform
piano-library, which soon will embrace 10,000 numbers. Nay, the
“Moonlight Sonata” is already to be purchased for a penny. And
yet we must confess that really beautiful editions of bibliographical
value are not to be found. An edition in artistic binding, on thick
paper, in elegant engraving, following the best original copy, with
none of those instructive but unornamental marks of fingering or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>phrasing, and at the same time well
adapted for opening out without injury,
and calculated for perfect typographical
pictures on every page—why
is there no such edition of
Beethoven, when people can be found
who will pay ten or twelve thousand
pounds for a piano?</p>

<p>Where the historic tendency is so
well marked, creativeness has degenerated.
Since the middle of the century
plenty of good sound stuff has
been written for the piano; but it
must be confessed that piano-music
has shown no tendency to strike out a new path. No commanding
or revolutionary personality, like Schumann, Chopin,
or Liszt, has arisen. Almost all modern production is but the
popularisation of Liszt, or a respectable mean between Chopin
and Schumann.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Hiller began the endless succession of these eclectic
musicians. But the last of the solid old style was Alkan, a solitary,
eccentric, misanthropic, but withal interesting old man. He was
born in Paris in 1813, and remained there. He was one of the
many pupils of Zimmermann, that modest but most influential
teacher. Alkan’s pieces were highly esteemed by Bülow, who
gave him a place in his list of Étude-masters. In his works,
which are chiefly Études and Preludes, there speaks a Berlioz,
with an elemental and realistic power. He stands in his kind
half-way between Chopin and Liszt. Some pieces, like the
highly original <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 39, 1, do not easily fade out of the memory.
The seventh of the twelve Études, dedicated to Fétis, is a
remarkably significant Chopin-like Ballade in Berlioz’ style,
with kettle-drum rolls, and other most peculiar harmonic and
orchestral effects. In the “Allegro Barbaro” of the fifth Étude
he gives full play to his propensity to exotic phrases of foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
colouring. He works with uncanny, lengthy unisons, or with
cutting climbing ninths. An out-and-out romantic, he delights
not merely to rush into the middle of his pieces with explanatory
words—“Mors” is one of these—but he has hit upon the most
original titles that ever an association of ideas led a composer
to adopt: “Pseudo-naïveté,” “Fais Dodo,” “Heraclitus and
Democritus,” “Railroad,” “Odi profanum vulgus,” “Morituri te
salutant.” To play his pieces is as difficult as to construe the
Talmud.</p>

<p>A constant succession of romantic writers of Études or small
pieces stretches from that era to our own. First stands the
intellectual Volkmann; next, the somewhat too dainty Kirchner,
a regular album-writer, who went so far in his admiration for
Schumann as to publish “New Davidsbündler” and “The New
Florestan and Eusebius.” Adolf Henselt, who lived at St
Petersburg, practised an extraordinary longdrawn legato technique.
He is still esteemed for his tolerable F minor Concerto,
and for his second and fifth Études, especially the well-known
“Si oiseau j’étais.” Stephen Heller, who lived in Paris, wrote
a hundred and forty-nine works, almost exclusively for the piano.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
He is a combination of Schumann,
Chopin, Mendelssohn,
and water; but we light occasionally
on passages of some
inspiration. His well-known
Saltarellos and Tarantelles, his
effective “Forellen” (Trout)
Fantasia, and his excellent
“Danses Bois,” are in the
taste of the time. More important
was his pretty idea,
in the Freischütz Studies, of
uniting operatic motives and
étude-practice in an organic
and poetic combination.</p>

<p>The lesser Romantics and
Romanticists were meanwhile
working diligently in Paris. A group of successful piano-composers
of this class reaches down to our own day. The
chief names are Fauré, Widor, Vincent d’Indy, Chabrier, César
Franck, Dubois, Cécile Chaminade, Paul Lacombe. The drawing-room
romance, which in Chaminade unfortunately tends too often
to shallowness, exhibits often a Mendelssohnian classicism, of
which dainty specimens are given in Lacombe’s Toccatina, and
in the Toccata of Chaminade herself. The literature for two
pianos is well illustrated in Chabrier’s Romantic Waltzes, which
are unusually spirited. César Franck’s symphonic variations,
serious and academic, and St Saens’ Concertos, more interesting
in their effective technique than in content, stand out from the
mass of orchestral piano-work.</p>

<p>An equally important group is that of the Russians, headed by
the emotional and highly-strung Tschaïkowski, whom Bülow, not
without justice, honoured with his special admiration. Tschaïkowski’s
variations are one of the soundest and most genuine of
modern piano works; and the B flat minor concerto has a swing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
and rush that carries us away. His Sonata, not only by its
application of national themes, but specially by the national
colouring of the episodic parts, down to the light and shade of
the figurations, is unique among piano pieces. He was simpler
and more popular in his numerous drawing-room pieces, which
constantly reward study by a spirited phrase or unusual harmony.
The school of older and younger Russians has worked on the
same popular lines. To this school belong Borodin, Cui, Liadoff,
Rimsky-Korsakoff, Mussorgsky, Glazounow, Naprawnik. A third
group is that of the Scandinavians, who gained importance in
Europe about the middle of the century, not merely in fiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
and painting, but in music also. But they were rather inspired
than inspirers. Their leader is Grieg, whose well-known concerto
<abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 16, in spite of certain eccentricities, has a very flowing course
suggesting the united influence of many predecessors. His themes
are good specimens of a music which is not the product of
experience, but of invention. Scores of variations and dainty
isolated pieces keep the same happy and attractive medium
between the shallow and the interesting. They are in any case
more important than Gade’s Mendelssohniana. For a long time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
less known, but far deeper and more genuine than Grieg, is
Halfdan Kjerulf, whose works have been republished by Arno
Kleffel (Simon). Humorous little pieces in the post-romantic
style, but of concentrative ability, deserve the highest praise a
Romantic can receive; they are like Schubert in spirit. Among
the later Scandinavians, Schytte and Sinding have tried no new
paths; Stenhammer, also of importance as a virtuoso, has given
us works of pith and character, which may rank among the first.</p>

<p>In England and America, in later times, Graham Moore and
Macdowell may claim notice as lesser Romantics. The former
is not free from triviality; the latter invents with more delicate
genius, and has written a very respectable piano-concerto. But
Germany may still boast that she retains the supremacy.</p>

<p>From the group of German post-Romantics, which found in
Franz Brendel a very fertile composer of programme tone-pictures,
two great personalities drew apart. Adolf Jensen was the inheritor
of Schumann’s emotion, Johannes Brahms of Schumann’s musical
character. Jensen, whose character is the mean between Chopin
and Schumann, has left behind him music which will not die, in
his clear-cut and splendidly worked-out Suites, in his emotional
“Wanderbilder” and Idylls, in the unique Eroticon, which
characterises the different forms of love in separate movements,
and in the four-handed wedding music, which is lovely and full
of power. But Brahms inherited from his patron Schumann, not
youth, not this simple thinking and inventing, but manhood, in
which music became an absolute self-supported world. He worked
in the world of tone, with no trace of virtuosity, with not a suspicion
of a concession to the understanding of the mere amateur.
His Sonatas and Concertos, the sparkling Scherzo <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 4, the Variations,
the Études, even the four-handed waltzes and the unique
“Liebes-lieder” waltzes—for four hands with voices—there has, in
our time, been no music written so free from the slightest condescension.
Stubborn, at times repellent, even in her smiles not very
gracious, this music seeks to make no proselytes; but whomsoever
she wins as a friend, she holds fast and allows that rarest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
pleasures—the pursuit of
lofty aims, and the quiet
rapture of a student.</p>

<p>Over against these
two originals stands
Joachim Raff, the eclectic.
We have grown accustomed
to count his eclecticism
no reproach, for
never did man more
bitterly experience the
sorrow of art. His great
legacy of piano-pieces
will at least give a good
picture of the time. In
them the most commonplace
demands of art are
mingled with the most
heart-felt lamentations—as they never mingled except in our age.
They are a long catalogue of virtues and vices, from the hapless
Polka de la Reine to the Sonatas, in which, whether for piano
alone, or more especially for piano and violin, he attained astonishing
heights; from the ravishingly graceful suite-movements to the
romanticism of his lyrical songs. And over all broods the unrest
of the time.</p>

<p>Among living Germans the same two main groups are in
general to be distinguished: the artists of the serious, self-sufficient
music, and the poets of the lighter, post-romantic <i lang="fr">genre</i>. Rheinberger’s
sound and solid Sonatas and smaller pieces are the purest
representatives of the more absolute conception of music, and they
deserve the highest praise. Richard Strauss, also, in his earlier
years, came out with some remarkably original piano-pieces, which
betrayed a strong sense for absolute music. I would mention
particularly the pithy Burlesque for Orchestra and Piano. In such
serious and solid endeavour Wilhelm Berger stands out among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
younger masters. But—as in the middle section of his great
variations for two pianos—he must beware of a too great fluency,
which is the stumbling-block of all absolute musical emotion.</p>

<p>Eugene d’Albert, in spirit, resembles Brahms. This appears
most clearly in the eight massive Piano-pieces of his <abbr title="Opus">Op.</abbr> 5, which live
by their infelt music, and are in that respect to be numbered amongst
the noblest fruits of modern piano-literature. This inclination to
absolute music appeared even in his first work, a very interesting
Suite, and has received further active expression in certain arrangements
of Bach, which take a front rank along with those of Busoni.
Among his piano-concertos, the second, which is included in a
single movement, is without serious rival, at least among works
that have appeared since Liszt, in wealth of invention and variety
of colour. His secular turn will probably continue itself in his
later works, which, in consequence of his devotion to opera, will
necessarily cease to be influenced by Bach and Brahms.</p>

<p>Paderewski stands perhaps on the dividing line between the
severer absolute musicians, in whose style he composed his Variations
and Humoresques à l’antique, and the daintier drawing-room
romantics, with whom he associates himself specially in numerous
fiery Polish dances. His Concerto in A minor is absolutely bathed
in this national spirit.</p>

<p>Xaver Scharwenka strikes a similar note. Something of
Chopin at his best still lives in him; and his Concertos, above
all, have given him a name as a composer. His brother Philip
renounces the virtuoso, and appears rather as a teacher and former
of taste. He has created a rich piano-literature, which prefers to
deal in graceful and <i lang="fr">galant</i> forms, and holds itself utterly aloof
from storm and revolution. Scharwenka has the rare merit of
having successfully cultivated four-handed piano music; and his
“Herbstbilder” and “Abendmusik” belong to the most tasteful
productions of this class. Among his multiform “Jugendstücke”
the “Kinderspiele,” in several volumes, are the most
successful. A similar activity has been shown by Wilhelm Kienzl,
who has been able to work the light romantic <i lang="fr">genre</i> in all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
aspects. Kienzl is one of our most fertile piano-composers. His
pieces are all occasional, thought out for delicate orchestral effects,
and thus are extremely unassuming. His “Boat-Scene” gained
the special approval of Liszt, while his Dance Airs and Dance
Pictures belong to the most popular class of piano-works. His
illustrated cycle “Child-love and Life,” which appeared with text
in four languages, seeks to apply to the piano the method of
intuitive instruction. The cycle “From my Diary” is the best
example of the specially subtle and suggestive touch, by which
Kienzl attains his detailed orchestral effects; while the two
volumes, “A Poet’s Journey,” are to be regarded as his ripest
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
Moritz Moszkowski, who has not yet laid aside his career as a
virtuoso, and only the other day appeared with a new piano-concerto,
is among the most remarkable in the band of modern
piano-poets. A delicate and polished virtuosity, as it appears in
the Etincelles and the Tarantelle, is allied with a characteristic
force in form, which has made his four-handed Spanish dances,
and his “From Foreign Parts,” so popular.</p>

<p>History shows that the piano only flourishes in a pronounced
opposition to the opera, which is the other extreme, the triumph
of all arts united. The opera seeks to realise the impossible; it
calls into requisition a whole world of forces in order to grasp
in a sensuous manner the heights of life. It forms a Titanic
resolve to build mountains out of sand; an intoxication, an extraordinary
consciousness of victory, gives wings to this most daring
of experiments. A great man once appeared, who made Dionysus
his lord, and sought to win from the stage a mirror of the world
and worldly honour. We stand on the fair ruins of his splendid
failure. We have been instructed, we have been elevated; but
the tragedy of the theatre is too deep. Then come the hours
in which we flee to the household-ingle of chamber-music, and
strive to disentangle its enlacing lines, in which we see the whole
of life included, since it depicts itself without the need of foreign
aid. The piano will further be the central point of this introspection.
Let us have no concertos, in which this delicate instrument
is dragged before the crowd and has to fight a duel with
the orchestra. All beautiful compositions notwithstanding, the
piano is no concerto-instrument. In concertos the delicate ear
is outraged. The piano will not adapt itself for new ideas in the
hall, in the midst of virtuosity, or against the orchestra. It must
become chaste; it must turn in faith to Bach’s Wohltemperiertes
Klavier, the Old Testament, as Bülow called it, of the musician’s
creed, and to Beethoven’s Sonatas, the New.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in Schytte’s “Silhouettes,” or Variations
on the same theme in the different styles of various Masters,
he nowhere fails so badly as with Bach, who is marked by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
retardations in the middle voices, or with Beethoven, who is
characterised by gloomy rhythm. The true path seems to have
been lost. The line through Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, and
Brahms, is the only safe line for the piano; and it is the line in
music furthest removed from the opera. In those great natures,
whether they knew it or not, was a strong repugnance to the
opera; and Brahms, whose eulogists said he was the last of his
race, will perhaps one day be viewed as the connecting link
between the old and a new musical culture.</p>

<p>It is in chamber-music alone that we have the right to look
for great triumphs in the immediate future; triumphs of which
Klinger’s “Radierungen,” Brahms’s “Clarinet Quintet” or Smetana’s
“Aus Meinem Leben,” are at once the anticipation and the
guarantee.</p>

<p>It is for our children to see to it that the great traditions of
the past are not forgotten; and that the building which it will
fall to them to erect is not unworthy of its foundation.</p>

<p class="p2">Prosniz’s <span lang="de">“Handbuch der Klavier-litteratur,”</span> which goes down
to 1830, and the new edition of Weitzmann’s “History of Piano-playing
and Piano-literature,” now in preparation, supply a complete
apparatus of all the sources of information necessary to the
student. Thus I have been able in this work, to the exclusion
of all dryasdust references to authorities, to present the development
of piano-literature from the point of view of culture and
of human interest. For procuring the material which lies in the
works themselves and contemporary writings, I am indebted to
the labours of Dr Kopfermann, Director of The Royal Library
of Music at Berlin. I am enabled to give the illustrations by
the extreme kindness of Mr Otto Lessmann, the Baroness
Wilhelm von Rothschild, Mr Nicolas Manskopf, Mr Edwin
Bechstein, Mr de Wit, Madame Bülow, Madame Marie Fellinger,
